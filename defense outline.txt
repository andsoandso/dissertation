1. Rewards
    - 1, 2, !
    - Two facts:
        * ``cognitive'' v classical
    - How do cognitive reward work? Posit: they're categories
        * 1 -> 2 via RL
        * How do cognitive rewards become rewards?
            - Idea: rewards are categories
                * Categories implicity allow for similarity-based inference
2. Reward prediction errors not rewards are the lens we'll use
    - What are RPE, 
    - and support for
3. Categories and Shepard
4. I am interested in computation; The theory to be tested.
    - Maths
    - Phenomenonical differences
5. The task to model
    - task
    - learning
    - model fits ....
6. fMRI 
    - methods in brief, focusing on model ranks, specifically Akaike Weights
    - mention the codes
    - maps
    - results
7. Conclusions
