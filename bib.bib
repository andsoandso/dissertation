title = {Multiple systems of category learning},
abstract = {We review neuropsychological and neuroimaging evidence for the existence of three qualitatively different categorization systems. These categorization systems are themselves based on three distinct memory systems: working memory (WM), explicit long-term memory (explicit LTM), and implicit long-term memory (implicit LTM). We first contrast categorization based on WM with that based on explicit LTM, where the former typically involves applying rules to a test item and the latter involves determining the similarity between stored exemplars or prototypes and a test item. Neuroimaging studies show differences between brain activity in normal participants as a function of whether they are instructed to categorize novel test items by rule or by similarity to known category members. Rule instructions typically lead to more activation in frontal or parietal areas, associated with WM and selective attention, whereas similarity instructions may activate parietal areas associated with the integration of perceptual features. Studies with neurological patients in the same paradigms provide converging evidence, e.g., patients with Alzheimer's disease, who have damage in prefrontal regions, are more impaired with rule than similarity instructions. Our second contrast is between categorization based on explicit LTM with that based on implicit LTM. Neuropsychological studies with patients with medial-temporal lobe damage show that patients are impaired on tasks requiring explicit LTM, but perform relatively normally on an implicit categorization task. Neuroimaging studies provide converging evidence: whereas explicit categorization is mediated by activation in numerous frontal and parietal areas, implicit categorization is mediated by a deactivation in posterior cortex.},

title = {Dissociating the contributions of independent corticostriatal systems to visual categorization learning through the use of reinforcement learning modeling and Granger causality modeling},
abstract = {We dissociated the contributions to learning of four corticostriatal "loops" (interacting striatal and cortical regions): motor (putamen and motor cortex), visual (posterior caudate and visual cortex), executive (anterior caudate and prefrontal cortex), and motivational (ventral striatum and ventromedial frontal cortex). Subjects learned to categorize individual repeated images into one of two arbitrary categories via trial and error. We identified (1) regions sensitive to correct categorization, categorization learning, and feedback valence; (2) regions sensitive to prediction error (violation of feedback expectancy) and reward prediction (expected feedback associated with category response) using reinforcement learning modeling; and (3) directed influences between regions using Granger causality modeling. Each loop showed a unique pattern of sensitivity to each of these factors. Both the motor and visual loops were involved in acquisition of categorization ability: activity during correct categorization increased across learning and was sensitive to reward prediction. However, the posterior caudate received directed influence from visual cortex, whereas the putamen exerted directed influence on motor cortex. The motivational and executive loops were involved in feedback processing: both regions were sensitive to feedback valence, which interacted with learning across scans. However, the motivational loop activity reflected prediction error, whereas executive loop activity reflected reward prediction, consistent with the executive loop role in integrating reward and action. Granger causality modeling found directed influences between striatal and cortical regions within each loop. Across loops, the motor loop exerted directed influence on the executive loop which is consistent with the role of the executive loop in integrating feedback with stimulus-response history.},

abstract = {Evidence indicates that dopaminergic medication in Parkinson's disease may impair certain aspects of cognitive function, such as reversal learning. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging in patients with mild Parkinson's disease to investigate the neural site at which L-DOPA acts during reversal learning. Patients were scanned both ON and OFF their normal dopamine-enhancing L-DOPA medication during the performance of a probabilistic reversal learning task. We demonstrate that L-DOPA modulated reversal-related activity in the nucleus accumbens, but not in the dorsal striatum or the prefrontal cortex. These data concur with evidence from studies with experimental animals and indicate an important role for the human nucleus accumbens in the dopaminergic modulation of reversal learning.},

title = {Two-photon Imaging of Synaptic Plasticity and Pathology in the Living Mouse Brain},
abstract = {Summary Two-photon microscopy (TPM) has become an increasingly important tool for imaging the structure and function of brain cells in living animals. TPM imaging studies of neuronal structures over intervals ranging from seconds to years have begun to provide important insights into the structural plasticity of synapses and the modulating effects of experience in the intact brain. TPM has also started to reveal how neuronal connections are altered in animal models of neurodegeneration, acute brain injury, and cerebrovascular disease. Here, we review some of these studies with special emphasis on the degree of structural dynamism of postsynaptic dendritic spines in the adult mouse brain as well as synaptic pathology in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease and cerebral ischemia. We also discuss technical considerations that are critical for the acquisition and interpretation of data from TPM in vivo.},

title = {Temporal prediction errors in a passive learning task activate human striatum},
abstract = {Functional MRI experiments in human subjects strongly suggest that the striatum participates in processing information about the predictability of rewarding stimuli. However, stimuli can be unpredictable in character (what stimulus arrives next), unpredictable in time (when the stimulus arrives), and unpredictable in amount (how much arrives). These variables have not been dissociated in previous imaging work in humans, thus conflating possible interpretations of the kinds of expectation errors driving the measured brain responses. Using a passive conditioning task and fMRI in human subjects, we show that positive and negative prediction errors in reward delivery time correlate with BOLD changes in human striatum, with the strongest activation lateralized to the left putamen. For the negative prediction error, the brain response was elicited by expectations only and not by stimuli presented directly; that is, we measured the brain response to nothing delivered (juice expected but not delivered) contrasted with nothing delivered (nothing expected).},

annote = {By  building an expectation an association between a simple visual cue, and a juice reward (a stim-stim paradigm), then temporal violating that expectation (leading to both a negative delta, where the reward was expected anda postive delta, due to temporally surprising reward) they showed a significant activation (neg and pos respectivly) in the left lateral putamen (in the glm).

And consistent with previos expectation showed nuc acc activation (t-tests on raw bold, not in the glm) which had prev been shown senstive to violations of temporal expectation.  

How valid/informative are t-tests when the glm failes to find signifcance overall?

They also saw no sig activation for cue-cue (no reward) violations.  What does this mean for our grammar studies?

"If our grammar sequence violations shows an effect w R, then does this imply that we have rendered a previously unobs event visible, or that an explcit R IS required, at some point in epoch/event.  Can we modify to test this?  Like say render the sequence more salient in another, non-explicit rewarding fashiion.  How to?"

Given these results, what can we expect R-jitter to do to our data, as far as applying TD models goes?

title = {Optical Recording of Action Potentials with Second-Harmonic Generation Microscopy},
abstract = {Nonlinear microscopy has proven to be essential for neuroscience investigations of thick tissue preparations. However, the optical recording of fast ({\$}[{\$}\~{\$}]{\$}1 msec) cellular electrical activity has never until now been successfully combined with this imaging modality. Through the use of second-harmonic generation microscopy of primary Aplysia neurons in culture labeled with 4-{\$}[{\$}4-(dihexylamino)phenyl{\$}]{\$}{\$}[{\$}ethynyl{\$}]{\$}-1-(4-sulfobutyl)pyridinium (inner salt), we optically recorded action potentials with 0.833 msec temporal and 0.6 \micro\m spatial resolution on soma and neurite membranes. Second-harmonic generation response as a function of change in membrane potential was found to be linear with a signal change of {\$}[{\$}\~{\$}]{\$}6%/100 mV. The signal-to-noise ratio was {\$}[{\$}\~{\$}]{\$}1 for single-trace action potential recordings but was readily increased to {\$}[{\$}\~{\$}]{\$}6-7 with temporal averaging of {\$}[{\$}\~{\$}]{\$}50 scans. Photodamage was determined to be negligible by observing action potential characteristics, cellular resting potential, and gross cellular morphology during and after laser illumination. High-resolution (micrometer scale) optical recording of membrane potential activity by previous techniques has been limited to imaging depths an order of magnitude less than nonlinear methods. Because second-harmonic generation is capable of imaging up to {\$}[{\$}\~{\$}]{\$}400 \micro\m deep into intact tissue with submicron resolution and little out-of-focus photodamage or bleaching, its ability to record fast electrical activity should prove valuable to future electrophysiology studies.},

title = {Neural correlates of a reversal learning task with an affectively neutral baseline: an event-related fMRI study},
abstract = {Reversal learning may conceptually be dissected into acquiring stimulus-reinforcement associations and subsequently altering behavior by switching to new associations as stimulus-reinforcement contingencies reverse (i.e., affective switching). Previous imaging studies have found regions of the ventrolateral and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) to be involved in both subprocesses. However, these studies did not contain an affectively neutral baseline, which precluded adequate assessment of main effects of reward, punishment, and affective switching. We aimed to determine the neural substrate of these main effects, and of common and dissociable regions for reward and punishment. Furthermore, we aimed to discriminate between stimulus-punishment association and affective switching, i.e., to assess affective switching proper. To this end, we implemented a reversal learning task with an affectively neutral baseline condition that matched the experimental task in visual complexity and motor demands. Interestingly, we found dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior PFC to be engaged in affective switching, a finding that has not been reported before to our knowledge. Enhanced responses in these areas may represent their involvement in cognitive set shifting per se unrelated to the affective context in a reversal learning design. In addition, OFC, insular and medial prefrontal cortex regions were involved in affective switching. Left medial and lateral OFC were shown to be common areas for feedback processing, whereas left ventral striatum and left lateral OFC were specifically activated by reward and punishment, respectively. These results extend our understanding of the neural substrate of reversal learning in humans.},

Here, we review models of the higher level aspects of human intelligence, which depend critically on the prefrontal cortex and associated subcortical areas. The picture emerging from a convergence of detailed mechanistic models and more abstract functional models represents a synthesis between analog and digital forms of computation. Specifically, the need for robust active maintenance and rapid updating of information in the prefrontal cortex appears to be satisfied by bistable activation states and dynamic gating mechanisms. These mechanisms are fundamental to digital computers and may be critical for the distinctive aspects of human intelligence.},

title = {Robustness of optimal design of fMRI experiments with application of a genetic algorithm},
abstract = {In this paper we apply the genetic algorithm developed by Kao et al. (2009) to find designs which are robust against misspecification of the error autocorrelation. Two common optimality criteria, the A-optimality criterion and the D-optimality criterion, based upon a general linear model are employed to obtain locally optimal designs for a given value of the autocorrelation. The maximin criterion is then used to obtain designs which are robust against misspecification of the autocorrelation. Furthermore, robustness depending on the choice of optimality criterion is evaluated. We show analytically and empirically that the A- and D-optimality criterion will result in different optimal designs, e.g. with different stimulus frequencies. Optimal stimulus frequency for the A-optimality criterion has been derived by Liu et al. (2004) whereas we derive here the optimal stimulus frequency for the D-optimality criterion. Conclusions about the robustness of an optimal design against misspecification of model parameters and choice of optimality criterion are drawn based upon our results.},

abstract = {The orbitofrontal cortex (OBFc) has been suggested to code the motivational value of environmental stimuli and to use this information for the flexible guidance of goal-directed behavior. To examine whether information regarding reward prediction is quantitatively represented in the rat OBFc, neural activity was recorded during an olfactory discrimination "go"/"no-go" task in which five different odor stimuli were predictive for various amounts of reward or an aversive reinforcer. Neural correlates related to both actual and expected reward magnitude were observed. Responses related to reward expectation occurred during the execution of the behavioral response toward the reward site and within a waiting period prior to reinforcement delivery. About one-half of these neurons demonstrated differential firing toward the different reward sizes. These data provide new and strong evidence that reward expectancy, regardless of reward magnitude, is coded by neurons of the rat OBFc, and are indicative for representation of quantitative information concerning expected reward. Moreover, neural correlates of reward expectancy appear to be distributed across both motor and nonmotor phases of the task.},

In typical fMRI applications, pattern recognition algorithms "learn" a functional relationship between brain response patterns and a perceptual, cognitive or behavioral state of a subject expressed in terms of a label, which may assume discrete (classification) or continuous (regression) values. This learned functional relationship is then used to predict the unseen labels from a new data set ("brain reading"). In this article, we describe the mathematical foundations of machine learning applications in fMRI. We focus on two methods, support vector machines and relevance vector machines, which are respectively suited for the classification and regression of fMRI patterns. Furthermore, by means of several examples and applications, we illustrate and discuss the methodological challenges of using machine learning algorithms in the context of fMRI data analysis.},

abstract = {The central goal of modern science that evolved during the Enlightenment was the empirical reduction of uncertainty by experimental inquiry. Although there have been challenges to this view in the physical sciences, where profoundly indeterminate events have been identified at the quantum level, the presumption that physical phenomena are fundamentally determinate seems to have defined modern behavioral science. Programs like those of the classical behaviorists, for example, were explicitly anchored to a fully deterministic worldview, and this anchoring clearly influenced the experiments that those scientists chose to perform. Recent advances in the psychological, social, and neural sciences, however, have caused a number of scholars to begin to question the assumption that all of behavior can be regarded as fundamentally deterministic in character. Although it is not yet clear whether the generative mechanisms for human and animal behavior will require a philosophically indeterminate approach, it is clear that behavioral scientists of all kinds are beginning to engage the issues of indeterminacy that plagued physics at the beginning of the twentieth century.},

title = {Generalization of value in reinforcement learning by humans},
abstract = {Research in decision-making has focused on the role of dopamine and its striatal targets in guiding choices via learned stimulus-reward or stimulus-response associations, behavior that is well described by reinforcement learning theories. However, basic reinforcement learning is relatively limited in scope and does not explain how learning about stimulus regularities or relations may guide decision-making. A candidate mechanism for this type of learning comes from the domain of memory, which has highlighted a role for the hippocampus in learning of stimulus-stimulus relations, typically dissociated from the role of the striatum in stimulus-response learning. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and computational model-based analyses to examine the joint contributions of these mechanisms to reinforcement learning. Humans performed a reinforcement learning task with added relational structure, modeled after tasks used to isolate hippocampal contributions to memory. On each trial participants chose one of four options, but the reward probabilities for pairs of options were correlated across trials. This (uninstructed) relationship between pairs of options potentially enabled an observer to learn about option values based on experience with the other options and to generalize across them. We observed blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activity related to learning in the striatum and also in the hippocampus. By comparing a basic reinforcement learning model to one augmented to allow feedback to generalize between correlated options, we tested whether choice behavior and BOLD activity were influenced by the opportunity to generalize across correlated options. Although such generalization goes beyond standard computational accounts of reinforcement learning and striatal BOLD, both choices and striatal BOLD activity were better explained by the augmented model. Consistent with the hypothesized role for the hippocampus in this generalization, functional connectivity between the ventral striatum and hippocampus was modulated, across participants, by the ability of the augmented model to capture participants' choice. Our results thus point toward an interactive model in which striatal reinforcement learning systems may employ relational representations typically associated with the hippocampus.},

abstract = {In model-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), signals derived from a computational model for a specific cognitive process are correlated against fMRI data from subjects performing a relevant task to determine brain regions showing a response profile consistent with that model. A key advantage of this technique over more conventional neuroimaging approaches is that model-based fMRI can provide insights into how a particular cognitive process is implemented in a specific brain area as opposed to merely identifying where a particular process is located. This review will briefly summarize the approach of model-based fMRI, with reference to the field of reward learning and decision making, where computational models have been used to probe the neural mechanisms underlying learning of reward associations, modifying action choice to obtain reward, as well as in encoding expected value signals that reflect the abstract structure of a decision problem. Finally, some of the limitations of this approach will be discussed.},

title = {Spatio-temporal information analysis of event-related BOLD responses},
abstract = {A new approach for analysis of event-related fMRI (BOLD) signals is proposed. The technique is based on measures from information theory and is used both for spatial localization of task-related activity, as well as for extracting temporal information regarding the task-dependent propagation of activation across different brain regions. This approach enables whole brain visualization of voxels (areas) most involved in coding of a specific task condition, the time at which they are most informative about the condition, as well as their average amplitude at that preferred time. The approach does not require prior assumptions about the shape of the hemodynamic response function (HRF) nor about linear relations between BOLD response and presented stimuli (or task conditions). We show that relative delays between different brain regions can also be computed without prior knowledge of the experimental design, suggesting a general method that could be applied for analysis of differential time delays that occur during natural, uncontrolled conditions. Here we analyze BOLD signals recorded during performance of a motor learning task. We show that, during motor learning, the BOLD response of unimodal motor cortical areas precedes the response in higher-order multimodal association areas, including posterior parietal cortex. Brain areas found to be associated with reduced activity during motor learning, predominantly in prefrontal brain regions, are informative about the task typically at significantly later times.},

abstract = {Midbrain dopamine neurons are well known for their strong responses to rewards and their critical role in positive motivation. It has become increasingly clear, however, that dopamine neurons also transmit signals related to salient but nonrewarding experiences such as aversive and alerting events. Here we review recent advances in understanding the reward and nonreward functions of dopamine. Based on this data, we propose that dopamine neurons come in multiple types that are connected with distinct brain networks and have distinct roles in motivational control. Some dopamine neurons encode motivational value, supporting brain networks for seeking, evaluation, and value learning. Others encode motivational salience, supporting brain networks for orienting, cognition, and general motivation. Both types of dopamine neurons are augmented by an alerting signal involved in rapid detection of potentially important sensory cues. We hypothesize that these dopaminergic pathways for value, salience, and alerting cooperate to support adaptive behavior.},

title = {The effect of stimulus duty cycle and "off" duration on BOLD response linearity},
abstract = {An ongoing question in functional MRI is precisely how measured signal changes relate to neuronal activity. While this question has been probed using animal models and electrophysiologic measures of neuronal activity, it has also been probed by examining, in humans, the spatial location, magnitude, and temporal dynamics of signal changes to well understood stimuli. With regard to dynamics, several earlier studies have revealed a larger than expected response to brief stimuli, hypothesized to result from nonlinearities in either the hemodynamics or the neuronal activity. In this study, we investigate the linearity of the increase in blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrast as a function of stimulus duty cycle, as well as the linearity of the decrease in BOLD as a function stimulus "off" duration. These findings not only shed further light on the mechanisms behind BOLD contrast but also give practical information as to what to keep in mind when performing and interpreting event related fMRI experiments. These experiments demonstrated: a) the BOLD signal decrease, on stimulus cessation, was smaller than predicted by a linear system--opposite to what has been reported in the literature associated with a signal increase, and b) the deconvolved event-related BOLD signal is highly dependent on duty cycle (the fraction of time activated vs. non-activated), Several potential mechanisms explaining these dynamics are discussed and modeled. We find that the experimental results are most consistent with a nonlinear neuronal response, but do not rule out significant effects of nonlinear hemodynamic factors, in particular the nonlinear relationship between oxygen extraction fraction and blood flow.},

title = {Gene-gene interaction associated with neural reward sensitivity},
abstract = {Reward processing depends on dopaminergic neurotransmission and is modulated by factors affecting dopamine (DA) reuptake and degradation. We used fMRI and a guessing task sensitive to reward-related activation in the prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum to study how individual variation in genes contributing to DA reuptake [DA transporter (DAT)] and degradation [catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT)] influences reward processing. Prefrontal activity, evoked by anticipation of reward irrespective of reward probability and magnitude, was COMT genotype-dependent. Volunteers homozygous for the Met allele, associated with lower enzyme activity and presumably greater DA availability, showed larger responses compared with volunteers homozygous for the Val allele. A similar COMT effect was observed in the ventral striatum. As reported previously, the ventral striatum was also found to code gain-related expected value, i.e., the product of reward magnitude and gain probability. Individual differences in ventral striatal sensitivity for value were in part explained by an epistatic gene-gene interaction between COMT and DAT. Although most genotype combinations exhibited the expected activity increase with more likely and larger rewards, two genotype combinations (COMT Met/Met DAT 10R and COMT Val/Val 9R) were associated with blunted ventral striatal responses. In view of a consistent relationship between reduced reward sensitivity and addiction, our findings point to a potential genetic basis for vulnerability to addiction.},

In the present study, we tested patients with circumscribed surgical lesions in different regions of the frontal lobe on a new visual discrimination reversal test, which, in an fMRI study (O'Doherty, Kringelbach, Rolls, Hornak, {\&} Andrews, 2001), produced bilateral orbito-frontal cortex activation in normal subjects. In this task, touching one of two simultaneously presented patterns produced reward or loss of imaginary money delivered on a probabilistic basis to minimize the usefulness of verbal strategies. A number of types of feedback were present on the screen. The main result was that the group of patients with bilateral orbito-frontal cortex lesions were severely impaired at the reversal task, in that they accumulated less money. These patients often failed to switch their choice of stimulus after a large loss and often did switch their choice although they had just received a reward. The investigation showed that bilateral lesions were required for this deficit, since patients with unilateral orbito-frontal cortex (or medial prefrontal cortex) lesions were not impaired in the probabilistic reversal task. The task ruled out a simple motor disinhibition as an explanation of the deficit in the bilateral orbito-frontal cortex patients, in that the patients were required to choose one of two stimuli on each trial. A comparison group of patients with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex lesions was in some cases able to do the task, and in other cases, was impaired. Posttest debriefing showed that all the dorsolateral prefrontal patients who were impaired at the task had failed to pay attention to the crucial feedback provided on the screen after each trial about the amount won or lost on each trial. In contrast, all dorsolateral patients who paid attention to this crucial feedback performed normally on the reversal task. Further, it was confirmed that the bilateral orbito-frontal cortex patients had also paid attention to this crucial feedback, but in contrast had still performed poorly at the task. The results thus show that the orbital prefrontal cortex is required bilaterally for monitoring changes in the reward value of stimuli and using this to guide behavior in the task; whereas the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, if it produces deficits in the task, does so for reasons related to executive functions, such as the control of attention. Thus, the ability to determine which information is relevant when making a choice of pattern can be disrupted by a dorsolateral lesion on either side, whereas the ability to use this information to guide behavior is not disrupted by a unilateral lesion in either the left or the right orbito-frontal cortex, but is severely impaired by a bilateral lesion in this region. Because both abilities are important in many of the tasks and decisions that arise in the course of daily life, the present results are relevant to understanding the difficulties faced by patients after surgical excisions in different frontal brain regions.},

title = {Surprise! Neural correlates of Pearce-Hall and Rescorla-Wagner coexist within the brain},
abstract = {Learning theory and computational accounts suggest that learning depends on errors in outcome prediction as well as changes in processing of or attention to events. These divergent ideas are captured by models, such as Rescorla-Wagner (RW) and temporal difference (TD) learning on the one hand, which emphasize errors as directly driving changes in associative strength, vs. models such as Pearce-Hall (PH) and more recent variants on the other hand, which propose that errors promote changes in associative strength by modulating attention and processing of events. Numerous studies have shown that phasic firing of midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons carries a signed error signal consistent with RW or TD learning theories, and recently we have shown that this signal can be dissociated from attentional correlates in the basolateral amygdala and anterior cingulate. Here we will review these data along with new evidence: (i) implicating habenula and striatal regions in supporting error signaling in midbrain DA neurons; and (ii) suggesting that the central nucleus of the amygdala and prefrontal regions process the amygdalar attentional signal. However, while the neural instantiations of the RW and PH signals are dissociable and complementary, they may be linked. Any linkage would have implications for understanding why one signal dominates learning in some situations and not others, and also for appreciating the potential impact on learning of neuropathological conditions involving altered DA or amygdalar function, such as schizophrenia, addiction or anxiety disorders.},

title = {Temporal difference models and reward-related learning in the human brain},
abstract = {Temporal difference learning has been proposed as a model for Pavlovian conditioning, in which an animal learns to predict delivery of reward following presentation of a conditioned stimulus (CS). A key component of this model is a prediction error signal, which, before learning, responds at the time of presentation of reward but, after learning, shifts its response to the time of onset of the CS. In order to test for regions manifesting this signal profile, subjects were scanned using event-related fMRI while undergoing appetitive conditioning with a pleasant taste reward. Regression analyses revealed that responses in ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex were significantly correlated with this error signal, suggesting that, during appetitive conditioning, computations described by temporal difference learning are expressed in the human brain.},

abstract = {Language and music exhibit similar acoustic and structural properties, and both appear to be uniquely human. Several recent studies suggest that speech and music perception recruit shared computational systems, and a common substrate in Broca's area for hierarchical processing has recently been proposed. However, this claim has not been tested by directly comparing the spatial distribution of activations to speech and music processing within subjects. In the present study, participants listened to sentences, scrambled sentences, and novel melodies. As expected, large swaths of activation for both sentences and melodies were found bilaterally in the superior temporal lobe, overlapping in portions of auditory cortex. However, substantial nonoverlap was also found: sentences elicited more ventrolateral activation, whereas the melodies elicited a more dorsomedial pattern, extending into the parietal lobe. Multivariate pattern classification analyses indicate that even within the regions of blood oxygenation level-dependent response overlap, speech and music elicit distinguishable patterns of activation. Regions involved in processing hierarchical aspects of sentence perception were identified by contrasting sentences with scrambled sentences, revealing a bilateral temporal lobe network. Music perception showed no overlap whatsoever with this network. Broca's area was not robustly activated by any stimulus type. Overall, these findings suggest that basic hierarchical processing for music and speech recruits distinct cortical networks, neither of which involves Broca's area. We suggest that previous claims are based on data from tasks that tap higher-order cognitive processes, such as working memory and/or cognitive control, which can operate in both speech and music domains.},

abstract = {Pattern recognition methods have shown that functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data can reveal significant information about brain activity. For example, in the debate of how object categories are represented in the brain, multivariate analysis has been used to provide evidence of a distributed encoding scheme [Science 293:5539 (2001) 2425-2430]. Many follow-up studies have employed different methods to analyze human fMRI data with varying degrees of success [Nature reviews 7:7 (2006) 523-534]. In this study, we compare four popular pattern recognition methods: correlation analysis, support-vector machines (SVM), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and Gaussian na{\"\i}ve Bayes (GNB), using data collected at high field (7 Tesla) with higher resolution than usual fMRI studies. We investigate prediction performance on single trials and for averages across varying numbers of stimulus presentations. The performance of the various algorithms depends on the nature of the brain activity being categorized: for several tasks, many of the methods work well, whereas for others, no method performs above chance level. An important factor in overall classification performance is careful preprocessing of the data, including dimensionality reduction, voxel selection and outlier elimination.},

Games represent a widely accepted paradigm for representing interactive decision-making. We explored the potential value of neural networks for modeling and predicting human interactive learning in repeated games. We found that even very simple learning networks, driven by regret-based feedback, accurately predict observed human behavior in different experiments on 21 games with unique equilibria in mixed strategies. Introducing regret in the feedback dramatically improved the performance of the neural network. We show that regret-based models provide better predictions of learning than established economic models.},

To ensure optimal decision-making, the weight given to decision outcomes should reflect their salience in predicting future outcomes, and this salience should be modulated by the volatility of the reward environment. We show that human subjects assess volatility in an optimal manner and adjust decision-making accordingly. This optimal estimate of volatility is reflected in the fMRI signal in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) when each trial outcome is observed. When a new piece of information is witnessed, activity levels reflect its salience for predicting future outcomes. Furthermore, variations in this ACC signal across the population predict variations in subject learning rates. Our results provide a formal account of how we weigh our different experiences in guiding our future actions.},

abstract = {We studied the choice behavior of 2 monkeys in a discrete-trial task with reinforcement contingencies similar to those Herrnstein (1961) used when he described the matching law. In each session, the monkeys experienced blocks of discrete trials at different relative-reinforcer frequencies or magnitudes with unsignalled transitions between the blocks. Steady-state data following adjustment to each transition were well characterized by the generalized matching law; response ratios undermatched reinforcer frequency ratios but matched reinforcer magnitude ratios. We modelled response-by-response behavior with linear models that used past reinforcers as well as past choices to predict the monkeys' choices on each trial. We found that more recently obtained reinforcers more strongly influenced choice behavior. Perhaps surprisingly, we also found that the monkeys' actions were influenced by the pattern of their own past choices. It was necessary to incorporate both past reinforcers and past choices in order to accurately capture steady-state behavior as well as the fluctuations during block transitions and the response-by-response patterns of behavior. Our results suggest that simple reinforcement learning models must account for the effects of past choices to accurately characterize behavior in this task, and that models with these properties provide a conceptual tool for studying how both past reinforcers and past choices are integrated by the neural systems that generate behavior.},

title = {Differential responses in human striatum and prefrontal cortex to changes in object and rule relevance},
abstract = {Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure blood oxygenation level-dependent responses in 16 young healthy human volunteers during performance of an attentional switching task. The task allowed the separate investigation of lower-order switching between concrete objects and higher-order switching between abstract task rules. Significant signal change in the ventral striatum was demonstrated on trials when subjects switched between objects but not when subjects switched between abstract task rules. In contrast, signal change in the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) was observed during all switch trials. The switch-related responses were not contaminated by task difficulty, because the greatest signal change was observed during the relatively easy switch trials, which required both lower-order and higher-order switching at the same time. The present data suggest that mechanisms of inhibitory response control in frontostriatal systems are organized according to distinct levels of abstraction. Specifically, the response selection computation carried by the ventral striatum, which projects to the orbitofrontal cortex and the medial PFC, is restricted to the transformation of concrete stimulus exemplar information into motor responses, whereas the adaptive function of the lateral PFC extends to the transformation of abstract task-rule representations into action.},

title = {How the basal ganglia use parallel excitatory and inhibitory learning pathways to selectively respond to unexpected rewarding cues},
abstract = {After classically conditioned learning, dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) respond immediately to unexpected conditioned stimuli (CS) but omit formerly seen responses to expected unconditioned stimuli, notably rewards. These cells play an important role in reinforcement learning. A neural model explains the key neurophysiological properties of these cells before, during, and after conditioning, as well as related anatomical and neurophysiological data about the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTN), lateral hypothalamus, ventral striatum, and striosomes. The model proposes how two parallel learning pathways from limbic cortex to the SNc, one devoted to excitatory conditioning (through the ventral striatum, ventral pallidum, and PPTN) and the other to adaptively timed inhibitory conditioning (through the striosomes), control SNc responses. The excitatory pathway generates CS-induced excitatory SNc dopamine bursts. The inhibitory pathway prevents dopamine bursts in response to predictable reward-related signals. When expected rewards are not received, striosomal inhibition of SNc that is unopposed by excitation results in a phasic drop in dopamine cell activity. The adaptively timed inhibitory learning uses an intracellular spectrum of timed responses that is proposed to be similar to adaptively timed cellular mechanisms in the hippocampus and cerebellum. These mechanisms are proposed to include metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated Ca(2+) spikes that occur with different delays in striosomal cells. A dopaminergic burst in concert with a Ca(2+) spike is proposed to potentiate inhibitory learning. The model provides a biologically predictive alternative to temporal difference conditioning models and explains substantially more data than alternative models.},

abstract = {Dopamine has been widely implicated as a mediator of many of the behavioural responses to drugs of abuse. To test the hypothesis that dopamine is an essential mediator of various opiate-induced responses, we administered morphine to mice unable to synthesize dopamine. We found that dopamine-deficient mice are unable to mount a normal locomotor response to morphine, but a small dopamine-independent increase in locomotion remains. Dopamine-deficient mice have a rightward shift in the dose-response curve to morphine on the tail-flick test (a pain sensitivity assay), suggesting either a decreased sensitivity to the analgesic effects of morphine and/or basal hyperalgesia. In contrast, dopamine-deficient mice display a robust conditioned place preference for morphine when given either caffeine or l-dihydroxyphenylalanine (a dopamine precursor that restores dopamine throughout the brain) during the testing phases. Together, these data demonstrate that dopamine is a crucial component of morphine-induced locomotion, dopamine may contribute to morphine analgesia, but that dopamine is not required for morphine-induced reward as measured by conditioned place preference.},

title = {The debate over dopamine's role in reward: the case for incentive salience},
abstract = {Introduction Debate continues over the precise causal contribution made by mesolimbic dopamine systems to reward. There are three competing explanatory categories: `liking', learning, and `wanting'. Does dopamine mostly mediate the hedonic impact of reward (`liking')? Does it instead mediate learned predictions of future reward, prediction error teaching signals and stamp in associative links (learning)? Or does dopamine motivate the pursuit of rewards by attributing incentive salience to reward-related stimuli (`wanting')? Each hypothesis is evaluated here, and it is suggested that the incentive salience or `wanting' hypothesis of dopamine function may be consistent with more evidence than either learning or `liking'. In brief, recent evidence indicates that dopamine is neither necessary nor sufficient to mediate changes in hedonic `liking' for sensory pleasures. Other recent evidence indicates that dopamine is not needed for new learning, and not sufficient to directly mediate learning by causing teaching or prediction signals. By contrast, growing evidence indicates that dopamine does contribute causally to incentive salience. Dopamine appears necessary for normal `want- ing', and dopamine activation can be sufficient to enhance cue-triggered incentive salience. Drugs of abuse that promote dopamine signals short circuit and sensitize dynamic mesolimbic mechanisms that evolved to attribute incentive salience to rewards. Such drugs interact with incentive salience integrations of Pavlovian associative information with physiological state signals. That interac- tion sets the stage to cause compulsive `wanting' in addiction, but also provides opportunities for experiments to disentangle `wanting', `liking', and learning hypotheses. Results from studies that exploited those opportunities are described here.Conclusion In short, dopamine's contribution appears to be chiefly to cause `wanting' for hedonic rewards, more than `liking' or learning for those rewards.},

abstract = {Object and face representations in ventral temporal (VT) cortex were investigated by combining object confusability data from a computational model of object classification with neural response confusability data from a functional neuroimaging experiment. A pattern-based classification algorithm learned to categorize individual brain maps according to the object category being viewed by the subject. An identical algorithm learned to classify an image-based, view-dependent representation of the stimuli. High correlations were found between the confusability of object categories and the confusability of brain activity maps. This occurred even with the inclusion of multiple views of objects, and when the object classification model was tested with high spatial frequency "line drawings" of the stimuli. Consistent with a distributed representation of objects in VT cortex, the data indicate that object categories with shared image-based attributes have shared neural structure.},

abstract = {Behavioral studies suggest that making a decision involves representing the overall desirability of all available actions and then selecting that action that is most desirable. Physiological studies have proposed that neurons in the parietal cortex play a role in selecting movements for execution. To test the hypothesis that these parietal neurons encode the subjective desirability of making particular movements, we exploited Nash's game theoretic equilibrium, during which the subjective desirability of multiple actions should be equal for human players. Behavior measured during a strategic game suggests that monkeys' choices, like those of humans, are guided by subjective desirability. Under these conditions, activity in the parietal cortex was correlated with the relative subjective desirability of actions irrespective of the specific combination of reward magnitude, reward probability, and response probability associated with each action. These observations may help place many recent findings regarding the posterior parietal cortex into a common conceptual framework.},

Here, it is argued that further advances will require equal sophistication in parsing reward into its specific psychological components: (1) learning (including explicit and implicit knowledge produced by associative conditioning and cognitive processes); (2) affect or emotion (implicit 'liking' and conscious pleasure) and (3) motivation (implicit incentive salience 'wanting' and cognitive incentive goals). The challenge is to identify how different brain circuits mediate different psychological components of reward, and how these components interact.},

abstract = {A broad range of neural and behavioral data suggests that the brain contains multiple systems for behavioral choice, including one associated with prefrontal cortex and another with dorsolateral striatum. However, such a surfeit of control raises an additional choice problem: how to arbitrate between the systems when they disagree. Here, we consider dual-action choice systems from a normative perspective, using the computational theory of reinforcement learning. We identify a key trade-off pitting computational simplicity against the flexible and statistically efficient use of experience. The trade-off is realized in a competition between the dorsolateral striatal and prefrontal systems. We suggest a Bayesian principle of arbitration between them according to uncertainty, so each controller is deployed when it should be most accurate. This provides a unifying account of a wealth of experimental evidence about the factors favoring dominance by either system.},

However, it is only through Pavlovian responses that Pavlovian prediction learning is evident, and these responses can act against the instrumental interests of the subjects. This can be seen in both experimental and natural circumstances. In this paper we study the consequences of importing this competition into a reinforcement learning context, and demonstrate the resulting effects in an omission schedule and a maze navigation task. The misbehavior created by Pavlovian values can be quite debilitating; we discuss how it may be disciplined.},

title = {Brain mechanism of reward prediction under predictable and unpredictable environmental dynamics},
abstract = {In learning goal-directed behaviors, an agent has to consider not only the reward given at each state but also the consequences of dynamic state transitions associated with action selection. To understand brain mechanisms for action learning under predictable and unpredictable environmental dynamics, we measured brain activities by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a Markov decision task with predictable and unpredictable state transitions. Whereas the striatum and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) were significantly activated both under predictable and unpredictable state transition rules, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was more strongly activated under predictable than under unpredictable state transition rules. We then modelled subjects' choice behaviours using a reinforcement learning model and a Bayesian estimation framework and found that the subjects took larger temporal discount factors under predictable state transition rules. Model-based analysis of fMRI data revealed different engagement of striatum in reward prediction under different state transition dynamics. The ventral striatum was involved in reward prediction under both unpredictable and predictable state transition rules, although the dorsal striatum was dominantly involved in reward prediction under predictable rules. These results suggest different learning systems in the cortico-striatum loops depending on the dynamics of the environment: the OFC-ventral striatum loop is involved in action learning based on the present state, while the DLPFC-dorsal striatum loop is involved in action learning based on predictable future states.},

These results provide evidence that people are continually managing their self-concepts, seeking to assume or affirm valued personal identities.

title = {How the Basal Ganglia Use Parallel Excitatory and Inhibitory Learning Pathways to Selectively Respond to Unexpected Rewarding Cues},
abstract = {After classically conditioned learning, dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) respond immediately to unexpected conditioned stimuli (CS) but omit formerly seen responses to expected unconditioned stimuli, notably rewards. These cells play an important role in reinforcement learning. A neural model explains the key neurophysiological properties of these cells before, during, and after conditioning, as well as related anatomical and neurophysiological data about the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTN), lateral hypothalamus, ventral striatum, and striosomes. The model proposes how two parallel learning pathways from limbic cortex to the SNc, one devoted to excitatory conditioning (through the ventral striatum, ventral pallidum, and PPTN) and the other to adaptively timed inhibitory conditioning (through the striosomes), control SNc responses. The excitatory pathway generates CS-induced excitatory SNc dopamine bursts. The inhibitory pathway prevents dopamine bursts in response to predictable reward-related signals. When expected rewards are not received, striosomal inhibition of SNc that is unopposed by excitation results in a phasic drop in dopamine cell activity. The adaptively timed inhibitory learning uses an intracellular spectrum of timed responses that is proposed to be similar to adaptively timed cellular mechanisms in the hippocampus and cerebellum. These mechanisms are proposed to include metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated Ca2+ spikes that occur with different delays in striosomal cells. A dopaminergic burst in concert with a Ca2+ spike is proposed to potentiate inhibitory learning.

title = {Dialogues on prediction errors},
abstract = {The recognition that computational ideas from reinforcement learning are relevant to the study of neural circuits has taken the cognitive neuroscience community by storm. A central tenet of these models is that discrepancies between actual and expected outcomes can be used for learning. Neural correlates of such prediction-error signals have been observed now in midbrain dopaminergic neurons, striatum, amygdala and even prefrontal cortex, and models incorporating prediction errors have been invoked to explain complex phenomena such as the transition from goal-directed to habitual behavior. Yet, like any revolution, the fast-paced progress has left an uneven understanding in its wake. Here, we provide answers to ten simple questions about prediction errors, with the aim of exposing both the strengths and the limitations of this active area of neuroscience research.},

abstract = {The Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) has been extensively studied from the genetic and biochemical point of view. The main characteristic of the syndrome is the self-mutilation feature, which has been poorly studied and understood. We propose a new hypothesis about the self-mutilation physiopathology, which is related to the supersensitivity of the dopaminergic D1 receptors in the neuromatrix found in the cingulum cortex region. The LNS shows an increase of uric acid levels as a result of the deficiency of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase enzyme. This increase could induce damage to dopaminergic neurons. As a consequence, a decrease in dopamine synthesis during gestation and the early postnatal period could occur, producing a functional dopaminergic denervation of the 131 receptors, located on the prefrontal cortex, specifically in the cingulum bundle projections. This phenomenon could induce a codification disturbance in the `genetic body' of the neuromatrix, that could be expressed functionally as anosognosia, giving rise to self-mutilation. We suggest that this self-mutilation is a pain consciousness problem.},

abstract = {Humans can experience aftereffects from oriented stimuli that are not consciously perceived, suggesting that such stimuli receive cortical processing. Determining the physiological substrate of such effects has proven elusive owing to the low spatial resolution of conventional human neuroimaging techniques compared to the size of orientation columns in visual cortex. Here we show that even at conventional resolutions it is possible to use fMRI to obtain a direct measure of orientation-selective processing in V1. We found that many parts of V1 show subtle but reproducible biases to oriented stimuli, and that we could accumulate this information across the whole of V1 using multivariate pattern recognition. Using this information, we could then successfully predict which one of two oriented stimuli a participant was viewing, even when masking rendered that stimulus invisible. Our findings show that conventional fMRI can be used to reveal feature-selective processing in human cortex, even for invisible stimuli.},

Here, we review models of the higher level aspects of human intelligence, which depend critically on the prefrontal cortex and associated subcortical areas. The picture emerging from a convergence of detailed mechanistic models and more abstract functional models represents a synthesis between analog and digital forms of computation. Specifically, the need for robust active maintenance and rapid updating of information in the prefrontal cortex appears to be satisfied by bistable activation states and dynamic gating mechanisms. These mechanisms are fundamental to digital computers and may be critical for the distinctive aspects of human intelligence.},

title = {Learning- and expectation-related changes in the human brain during motor learning},
abstract = {We have studied a simple form of motor learning in the human brain so as to isolate activity related to motor learning and the prediction of sensory events. Whole-brain, event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to record activity during classical discriminative delay eyeblink conditioning. Auditory conditioned stimulus (CS+) trials were presented either with a corneal airpuff unconditioned stimulus (US, paired), or without a US (unpaired). Auditory CS- trials were never reinforced with a US. Trials were presented pseudorandomly, 66 times each. The subjects gradually produced conditioned responses to CS+ trials, while increasingly differentiating between CS+ and CS- trials. The increasing difference between hemodynamic responses for unpaired CS+ and for CS- trials evolved slowly during conditioning in the ipsilateral cerebellar cortex (Crus I/Lobule HVI), contralateral motor cortex and hippocampus. To localize changes that were related to sensory prediction, we compared trials on which the expected airpuff US failed to occur (Unpaired CS+) with trials on which it occurred as expected (Paired CS+). Error-related signals in the contralateral cerebellum and somatosensory cortex were seen to increase during learning as the sensory prediction became stronger. The changes seen in the ipsilateral cerebellar cortex may be due either to the violations of sensory predictions, or to learning-related increases in the excitability of cerebellar neurons to presentations of the CS+.},

title = {Primary food reward and reward-predictive stimuli evoke different patterns of phasic dopamine signaling throughout the striatum},
abstract = {Phasic changes in dopamine activity play a critical role in learning and goal-directed behavior. Unpredicted reward and reward-predictive cues evoke phasic increases in the firing rate of the majority of midbrain dopamine neurons - results that predict uniformly broadcast increases in dopamine concentration throughout the striatum. However, measurement of dopamine concentration changes during reward has cast doubt on this prediction. We systematically measured phasic changes in dopamine in four striatal subregions [nucleus accumbens shell and core (Core), dorsomedial (DMS) and dorsolateral striatum] in response to stimuli known to activate a majority of dopamine neurons. We used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in awake and behaving rats, which measures changes in dopamine on a similar timescale to the electrophysiological recordings that established a relationship between phasic dopamine activity and reward. Unlike the responses of midbrain dopamine neurons, unpredicted food reward and reward-predictive cues evoked a phasic increase in dopamine that was subregion specific. In rats with limited experience, unpredicted food reward evoked an increase exclusively in the Core. In rats trained on a discriminative stimulus paradigm, both unpredicted reward and reward-predictive cues evoked robust phasic dopamine in the Core and DMS. Thus, phasic dopamine release in select target structures is dynamic and dependent on context and experience. Because the four subregions assayed receive different inputs and have differential projection targets, the regional selectivity of phasic changes in dopamine has important implications for information flow through the striatum and plasticity that underlies learning and goal-directed behavior.},

title = {Representation of future and previous spatial goals by separate neural populations in prefrontal cortex},
abstract = {The primate prefrontal cortex plays a central role in choosing goals, along with a wide variety of additional functions, including short-term memory. In the present study, we examined neuronal activity in the prefrontal cortex as monkeys used abstract response strategies to select one of three spatial goals, a selection that depended on their memory of the most recent previous goal. During each trial, the monkeys selected a future goal on the basis of events from the previous trial, including both the symbolic visual cue that had appeared on that trial and the previous goal that the monkeys had selected. When a symbolic visual cue repeated from the previous trial, the monkeys stayed with their previous goal as the next (future) goal; when the cue changed, the monkeys shifted from their previous goal to one of the two remaining locations as their future goal. We found that prefrontal neurons had activity that reflected either previous goals or future goals, but only rarely did individual cells reflect both. This finding suggests that essentially separate neural networks encode these two aspects of spatial information processing. A failure to distinguish previous and future goals could lead to two kinds of maladaptive behavior. First, wrongly representing an accomplished goal as still pending could cause perseveration or compulsive checking, two disorders commonly attributed to dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex. Second, mistaking a pending goal as already accomplished could cause the failures of omission that occur commonly in dementia.},

Biological networks have been honed by many cycles of evolutionary selection pressure and are likely to yield reasonable solutions to such combinatorial optimization problems. Furthermore, they develop without centralized control and may represent a readily scalable solution for growing networks in general. We show that the slime mold Physarum polycephalum forms networks with comparable efficiency, fault tolerance, and cost to those of real-world infrastructure networks--in this case, the Tokyo rail system. The core mechanisms needed for adaptive network formation can be captured in a biologically inspired mathematical model that may be useful to guide network construction in other domains.},

abstract = {This article describes a method for selecting design parameters and a particular sequence of events in fMRI so as to maximize statistical power and psychological validity. Our approach uses a genetic algorithm (GA), a class of flexible search algorithms that optimize designs with respect to single or multiple measures of fitness. Two strengths of the GA framework are that (1) it operates with any sort of model, allowing for very specific parameterization of experimental conditions, including nonstandard trial types and experimentally observed scanner autocorrelation, and (2) it is flexible with respect to fitness criteria, allowing optimization over known or novel fitness measures. We describe how genetic algorithms may be applied to experimental design for fMRI, and we use the framework to explore the space of possible fMRI design parameters, with the goal of providing information about optimal design choices for several types of designs. In our simulations, we considered three fitness measures: contrast estimation efficiency, hemodynamic response estimation efficiency, and design counterbalancing. Although there are inherent trade-offs between these three fitness measures, GA optimization can produce designs that outperform random designs on all three criteria simultaneously.},

We showed that DBS selectively interferes with the normal ability to slow down when faced with decision conflict. While on DBS, patients actually sped up their decisions under high-conflict conditions. This form of impulsivity was not affected by dopaminergic medication status. Instead, medication impaired patients' ability to learn from negative decision outcomes. These findings implicate independent mechanisms leading to impulsivity in treated Parkinson's patients and were predicted by a single neurocomputational model of the basal ganglia.},

title = {Inactivation of the lateral but not medial dorsal striatum eliminates the excitatory impact of Pavlovian stimuli on instrumental responding},
abstract = {Conditioned stimuli are important guides for behavioral actions. This experiment determined the role of the dorsal striatum in conditioned-stimulus modulation of instrumental responding using the pavlovian-instrumental transfer (PIT) paradigm. Rats received pavlovian training wherein two different auditory stimuli predicted the delivery of two food rewards. Next, rats were trained to perform two instrumental actions earning the same two rewards. Finally, the impact of pavlovian stimuli on instrumental performance was assessed in extinction: the stimuli were periodically presented while rats were free to perform the lever-press response. Before testing, medial or lateral dorsal striatum was infused with saline or baclofen/muscimol, to temporarily inactivate the region. Under saline, outcome-selective PIT was observed: presentation of a stimulus paired with the same outcome as the instrumental action elevated responding, whereas presentation of a stimulus paired with a different outcome did not. Inactivation of the dorsolateral striatum dramatically reduced this effect. Inactivation of the dorsomedial striatum left intact the ability of reward-related stimuli to invigorate responding; however, the selectivity of the stimulus effect was lost (i.e., both stimuli excited responding). These results indicate that subregions of the dorsal striatum play distinct roles in stimulus modulation of instrumental performance with the lateral region being vital for reward-related stimuli to excite responding and the medial region being involved in the integration of stimulus-reward associations with specific response-outcome associations to produce selective responding. These findings identify new roles for the dorsal striatum in mediating the incentive effects of reward-predictive stimuli on behavioral actions made to obtain reward.},

abstract = {People are alarmingly susceptible to manipulations that change both their expectations and experience of the value of goods. Recent studies in behavioral economics suggest such variability reflects more than mere caprice. People commonly judge options and prices in relative terms, rather than absolutely, and display strong sensitivity to exemplar and price anchors. We propose that these findings elucidate important principles about reward processing in the brain. In particular, relative valuation may be a natural consequence of adaptive coding of neuronal firing to optimise sensitivity across large ranges of value. Furthermore, the initial apparent arbitrariness of value may reflect the brains' attempts to optimally integrate diverse sources of value-relevant information in the face of perceived uncertainty. Recent findings in neuroscience support both accounts, and implicate regions in the orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex in the construction of value.},

abstract = {Dopamine has a crucial role in anticipation of motiva- tional events. To investigate the underlying mecha- nisms of this process, we analyzed the activity of dopamine neurons and one of their major sources of input, neurons in the lateral habenula, while animals anticipated upcoming behavioral tasks. We found that lateral habenula and dopamine neurons anticipated tasks in two distinct manners. First, neurons encoded the timing distribution of upcoming tasks through gradual changes in their tonic activity. This tonic signal encoded rewarding tasks in prefer- ence to punishing tasks and was correlated with classic phasic coding of motivational value. Second, neurons transmitted a phasic signal marking the time when a task began. This phasic signal encoded rewarding and punishing tasks in similar manners, as though reflecting motivational salience. Our data suggest that the habenula-dopamine pathway moti- vates anticipation through a combination of tonic reward-related and phasic salience-related signals},

title = {Neural mechanisms of acquired phasic dopamine responses in learning},
abstract = {What biological mechanisms underlie the reward-predictive firing properties of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, and how do they relate to the complex constellation of empirical findings understood as Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning? We previously presented PVLV, a biologically inspired Pavlovian learning algorithm accounting for DA activity in terms of two interrelated systems: a primary value (PV) system, which governs how DA cells respond to a US (reward) and; a learned value (LV) system, which governs how DA cells respond to a CS. Here, we provide a more extensive review of the biological mechanisms supporting phasic DA firing and their relation to the spate of Pavlovian conditioning phenomena and their sensitivity to focal brain lesions. We further extend the model by incorporating a new NV (novelty value) component reflecting the ability of novel stimuli to trigger phasic DA firing, providing "novelty bonuses" which encourages exploratory working memory updating and in turn speeds learning in trace conditioning and other working memory-dependent paradigms. The evolving PVLV model builds upon insights developed in many earlier computational models, especially reinforcement learning models based on the ideas of Sutton and Barto, biological models, and the psychological model developed by Savastano and Miller. The PVLV framework synthesizes these various approaches, overcoming important shortcomings of each by providing a coherent and specific mapping to much of the relevant empirical data at both the micro- and macro-levels, and examines their relevance for higher order cognitive functions.},

title = {Where fMRI and electrophysiology agree to disagree: corticothalamic and striatal activity patterns in the WAG/Rij rat},
abstract = {The relationship between neuronal activity and hemodynamic changes plays a central role in functional neuroimaging. Under normal conditions and in neurological disorders such as epilepsy, it is commonly assumed that increased functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals reflect increased neuronal activity and that fMRI decreases represent neuronal activity decreases. Recent work suggests that these assumptions usually hold true in the cerebral cortex. However, less is known about the basis of fMRI signals from subcortical structures such as the thalamus and basal ganglia. We used WAG/Rij rats (Wistar albino Glaxo rats of Rijswijk), an established animal model of human absence epilepsy, to perform fMRI studies with blood oxygen level-dependent and cerebral blood volume (CBV) contrasts at 9.4 tesla, as well as laser Doppler cerebral blood flow (CBF), local field potential (LFP), and multiunit activity (MUA) recordings. We found that, during spike-wave discharges, the somatosensory cortex and thalamus showed increased fMRI, CBV, CBF, LFP, and MUA signals. However, the caudate-putamen showed fMRI, CBV, and CBF decreases despite increases in LFP and MUA signals. Similarly, during normal whisker stimulation, the cortex and thalamus showed increases in CBF and MUA, whereas the caudate-putamen showed decreased CBF with increased MUA. These findings suggest that neuroimaging-related signals and electrophysiology tend to agree in the cortex and thalamus but disagree in the caudate-putamen. These opposite changes in vascular and electrical activity indicate that caution should be applied when interpreting fMRI signals in both health and disease from the caudate-putamen, as well as possibly from other subcortical structures.},

title = {The influence of amphetamine on sensory and conditioned reinforcement: evidence for the re-selection hypothesis of dopamine function},
abstract = {In four experiments we assessed the effect of systemic amphetamine on the ability of a stimulus paired with reward and a stimulus that was not paired with reward to support instrumental conditioning; i.e., we trained rats to press two levers, one followed by a stimulus that had been trained in a predictive relationship with a food outcome and the other by a stimulus unpaired with that reward. Here we show, in general accord with predictions from the dopamine re-selection hypothesis [Redgrave and Gurney (2006). Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 7, 967-975], that systemic amphetamine greatly enhanced the performance of lever press responses that delivered a visual stimulus whether that stimulus had been paired with reward or not. In contrast, amphetamine had no effect on the performance of responses on an inactive lever that had no stimulus consequences. These results support the notion that dopaminergic activity serves to mark or tag actions associated with stimulus change for subsequent selection (or re-selection) and stand against the more specific suggestion that dopaminergic activity is solely related to the prediction of reward.},

title = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) "brain reading": detecting and classifying distributed patterns of fMRI activity in human visual cortex},
abstract = {Traditional (univariate) analysis of functional MRI (fMRI) data relies exclusively on the information contained in the time course of individual voxels. Multivariate analyses can take advantage of the information contained in activity patterns across space, from multiple voxels. Such analyses have the potential to greatly expand the amount of information extracted from fMRI data sets. In the present study, multivariate statistical pattern recognition methods, including linear discriminant analysis and support vector machines, were used to classify patterns of fMRI activation evoked by the visual presentation of various categories of objects. Classifiers were trained using data from voxels in predefined regions of interest during a subset of trials for each subject individually. Classification of subsequently collected fMRI data was attempted according to the similarity of activation patterns to prior training examples. Classification was done using only small amounts of data (20 s worth) at a time, so such a technique could, in principle, be used to extract information about a subject's percept on a near real-time basis. Classifiers trained on data acquired during one session were equally accurate in classifying data collected within the same session and across sessions separated by more than a week, in the same subject. Although the highest classification accuracies were obtained using patterns of activity including lower visual areas as input, classification accuracies well above chance were achieved using regions of interest restricted to higher-order object-selective visual areas. In contrast to typical fMRI data analysis, in which hours of data across many subjects are averaged to reveal slight differences in activation, the use of pattern recognition methods allows a subtle 10-way discrimination to be performed on an essentially trial-by-trial basis within individuals, demonstrating that fMRI data contain far more information than is typically appreciated.},

title = {Tonic dopamine: opportunity costs and the control of response vigor},
abstract = {RATIONALE: Dopamine neurotransmission has long been known to exert a powerful influence over the vigor, strength, or rate of responding. However, there exists no clear understanding of the computational foundation for this effect; predominant accounts of dopamine's computational function focus on a role for phasic dopamine in controlling the discrete selection between different actions and have nothing to say about response vigor or indeed the free-operant tasks in which it is typically measured. OBJECTIVES: We seek to accommodate free-operant behavioral tasks within the realm of models of optimal control and thereby capture how dopaminergic and motivational manipulations affect response vigor. METHODS: We construct an average reward reinforcement learning model in which subjects choose both which action to perform and also the latency with which to perform it. Optimal control balances the costs of acting quickly against the benefits of getting reward earlier and thereby chooses a best response latency. RESULTS: In this framework, the long-run average rate of reward plays a key role as an opportunity cost and mediates motivational influences on rates and vigor of responding. We review evidence suggesting that the average reward rate is reported by tonic levels of dopamine putatively in the nucleus accumbens. CONCLUSIONS: Our extension of reinforcement learning models to free-operant tasks unites psychologically and computationally inspired ideas about the role of tonic dopamine in striatum, explaining from a normative point of view why higher levels of dopamine might be associated with more vigorous responding.},

title = {Associative learning mediates dynamic shifts in dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens},
abstract = {The ability to predict favorable outcomes using environmental cues is an essential part of learned behavior. Dopamine neurons in the midbrain encode such stimulus-reward relationships in a manner consistent with contemporary learning models, but it is unclear how encoding this translates into actual dopamine release in target regions. Here, we sampled dopamine levels in the rat nucleus accumbens on a rapid (100 ms) timescale using electrochemical technology during a classical conditioning procedure. Early in conditioning, transient dopamine-release events signaled a primary reward, but not predictive cues. After repeated cue-reward pairings, dopamine signals shifted in time to predictive cue onset and were no longer observed at reward delivery. In the absence of stimulus-reward conditioning, there was no shift in the dopamine signal. Consistent with proposed roles in reward prediction and incentive salience, these results indicate that rapid dopamine release provides a reward signal that is dynamically modified by associative learning.},

abstract = {Action selection, the problem of choosing what to do next, is central to any autonomous agent architecture. We use here a multi-disciplinary approach at the convergence of neuroscience, dynamical system theory and autonomous robotics, in order to propose an efficient action selection mechanism based on a new model of the basal ganglia. We first describe new developments of contraction theory regarding locally projected dynamical systems. We exploit these results to design a stable computational model of the cortico-baso-thalamo-cortical loops. Based on recent anatomical data, we include usually neglected neural projections, which participate in performing accurate selection. Finally, the efficiency of this model as an autonomous robot action selection mechanism is assessed in a standard survival task. The model exhibits valuable dithering avoidance and energy-saving properties, when compared with a simple if-then-else decision rule.},

abstract = {Understanding the effects of motivation on instrumental action selection, and specifically on its two main forms, goal-directed and habitual control, is fundamental to the study of decision making. Motivational states have been shown to 'direct' goal-directed behavior rather straightforwardly towards more valuable outcomes. However, how motivational states can influence outcome-insensitive habitual behavior is more mysterious. We adopt a normative perspective, assuming that animals seek to maximize the utilities they achieve, and viewing motivation as a mapping from outcomes to utilities. We suggest that habitual action selection can direct responding properly only in motivational states which pertained during behavioral training. However, in novel states, we propose that outcome-independent, global effects of the utilities can 'energize' habitual actions.},

title = {Information processing, dimensionality reduction and reinforcement learning in the basal ganglia},
abstract = {Modeling of the basal ganglia has played a major role in our understanding of this elusive group of nuclei. Models of the basal ganglia have undergone evolutionary and revolutionary changes over the last 20 years, as new research in the fields of anatomy, physiology and biochemistry of these nuclei has yielded new information. Early models dealt with a single pathway through the nuclei and focused on the nature of the processing performed within it, convergence of information versus parallel processing of information. Later, the Albin-DeLong "box-and-arrow" model characterized the inter-nuclei interaction as multiple pathways while maintaining a simplistic scalar representation of the nuclei themselves. This model made a breakthrough by providing key insights into the behavior of these nuclei in hypo- and hyper-kinetic movement disorders. The next generation of models elaborated the intra-nuclei interactions and focused on the role of the basal ganglia in action selection and sequence generation which form the most current consensus regarding basal ganglia function in both normal and pathological conditions. However, new findings challenge these models and point to a different neural network approach to information processing in the basal ganglia. Here, we take an in-depth look at the reinforcement driven dimensionality reduction (RDDR) model which postulates that the basal ganglia compress cortical information according to a reinforcement signal using optimal extraction methods. The model provides new insights and experimental predictions on the computational capacity of the basal ganglia and their role in health and disease.},

abstract = {Dopaminergic neurons in the mammalian substantia nigra display characteristic phasic responses to stimuli which reliably predict the receipt of primary rewards. These responses have been suggested to encode reward prediction-errors similar to those used in reinforcement learning. Here, we propose a model of dopaminergic activity in which prediction-error signals are generated by the joint action of short-latency excitation and long-latency inhibition, in a network undergoing dopaminergic neuromodulation of both spike-timing dependent synaptic plasticity and neuronal excitability. In contrast to previous models, sensitivity to recent events is maintained by the selective modification of specific striatal synapses, efferent to cortical neurons exhibiting stimulus-specific, temporally extended activity patterns. Our model shows, in the presence of significant background activity, (i) a shift in dopaminergic response from reward to reward-predicting stimuli, (ii) preservation of a response to unexpected rewards, and (iii) a precisely timed below-baseline dip in activity observed when expected rewards are omitted.},

title = {Motor sequence complexity and performing hand produce differential patterns of hemispheric lateralization},
abstract = {Studies in brain damaged patients conclude that the left hemisphere is dominant for controlling heterogeneous sequences performed by either hand, presumably due to the cognitive resources involved in planning complex sequential movements. To determine if this lateralized effect is due to asymmetries in primary sensorimotor or association cortex, whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure differences in volume of activation while healthy right-handed subjects performed repetitive (simple) or heterogeneous (complex) finger sequences using the right or left hand. Advanced planning, as evidenced by reaction time to the first key press, was greater for the complex than simple sequences and for the left than right hand. In addition to the expected greater contralateral activation in the sensorimotor cortex (SMC), greater left hemisphere activation was observed for left, relative to right, hand movements in the ipsilateral left superior parietal area and for complex, relative to simple, sequences in the left premotor and parietal cortex, left thalamus, and bilateral cerebellum. No such volumetric asymmetries were observed in the SMC. Whereas the overall MR signal intensity was greater in the left than right SMC, the extent of this asymmetry did not vary with hand or complexity level. In contrast, signal intensity in the parietal and premotor cortex was greater in the left than right hemisphere and for the complex than simple sequences. Signal intensity in the caudal anterior cerebellum was greater bilaterally for the complex than simple sequences. These findings suggest that activity in the SMC is associated with execution requirements shared by the simple and complex sequences independent of their differential cognitive requirements. In contrast, consistent with data in brain damaged patients, the left dorsal premotor and parietal areas are engaged when advanced planning is required to perform complex motor sequences that require selection of different effectors and abstract organization of the sequence, regardless of the performing hand.},

title = {Measuring interregional functional connectivity using coherence and partial coherence analyses of fMRI data},
abstract = {Understanding functional connectivity within the brain is crucial to understanding neural function; even the simplest cognitive operations are supported by highly distributed neural circuits. We developed a novel method to measure task-related functional interactions between neural regions by applying coherence and partial coherence analyses to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Coherence and partial coherence are spectral measures that estimate the linear time-invariant (LTI) relationship between time series. They can be used to generate maps of task-specific connectivity associated with seed regions of interest (ROIs). These maps may then be compared across tasks, revealing nodes with task-related changes of connectivity to the seed ROI. To validate the method, we applied it to an event-related fMRI data set acquired while subjects performed two sequence tapping tasks, one of which required more bimanual coordination. Areas showing increased functional connectivity with both tasks were the same as those showing increased activity. Furthermore, though there were no significant differences in mean activity between the two tasks, significant increases in interhemispheric coherence were found between the primary motor (M1) and premotor (PM) regions for the task requiring more bimanual coordination. This increase in interhemispheric connectivity is supported by other brain imaging techniques as well as patient studies.},

abstract = {Optimising the efficiency of an experimental design is known to be of great importance. However, existing methods for calculating design rank deficiency and contrast estimability (an important aspect of experimental design) relate to computational precision rather than image noise and are therefore not very meaningful. For example, a contrast between two experimental conditions may be mathematically "estimable" while requiring a huge differential BOLD response for statistical significance to be reached. In this paper we formulate standard efficiency equations in terms of required BOLD effect, and use this to generate measures of rank/estimability which are meaningful. This takes into account the strength and smoothness of the timeseries noise and is applicable to complex contrasts; we show how to re-express several regressors and an associated contrast vector as a single equivalent regressor, so that we can calculate the contrast's effective peak-peak height unambiguously. We also present some example results on typical designs, and characterise noise results from a range of typical FMRI acquisitions, in order to allow experimenters to apply efficiency estimation in advance of acquiring data.},

abstract = {In outcome-specific transfer, pavlovian cues that are predictive of specific outcomes bias action choice toward actions associated with those outcomes. This transfer occurs despite no explicit training of the instrumental actions in the presence of pavlovian cues. The neural substrates of this effect in humans are unknown. To address this, we scanned 23 human subjects with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they made choices between different liquid food rewards in the presence of pavlovian cues previously associated with one of these outcomes. We found behavioral evidence of outcome-specific transfer effects in our subjects, as well as differential blood oxygenation level-dependent activity in a region of ventrolateral putamen when subjects chose, respectively, actions consistent and inconsistent with the pavlovian-predicted outcome. Our results suggest that choosing an action incompatible with a pavlovian-predicted outcome might require the inhibition of feasible but nonselected action-outcome associations. The results of this study are relevant for understanding how marketing actions can affect consumer choice behavior as well as for how environmental cues can influence drug-seeking behavior in addiction.},

Hi-res fMRI (voxel volume<or=(2 mm)3 is robustly achievable in human studies today using widely available clinical 3-Tesla scanners. However, the neuroscientific exploitation of the greater spatial detail poses four challenges: (1) Hi-res fMRI may give inaccurate (i.e. blurred, displaced and distorted) images of fine-scale neuronal activity patterns. (2) Single small voxels yield very noisy measurements. (3) The greater number of voxels complicates interpretation and poses a more severe multiple-comparisons problem. (4) The functional correspondency mapping between individual brains is unknown at the fine scale of millimeters. Here we argue that these challenges can be met by shifting the focus of brain mapping and visualizing, not the activity patterns themselves, but the amount of information they convey about the experimental conditions.},

title = {Different neural correlates of reward expectation and reward expectation error in the putamen and caudate nucleus during stimulus-action-reward association learning},
abstract = {To select appropriate behaviors leading to rewards, the brain needs to learn associations among sensory stimuli, selected behaviors, and rewards. Recent imaging and neural-recording studies have revealed that the dorsal striatum plays an important role in learning such stimulus-action-reward associations. However, the putamen and caudate nucleus are embedded in distinct cortico-striatal loop circuits, predominantly connected to motor-related cerebral cortical areas and frontal association areas, respectively. This difference in their cortical connections suggests that the putamen and caudate nucleus are engaged in different functional aspects of stimulus-action-reward association learning. To determine whether this is the case, we conducted an event-related and computational model-based functional MRI (fMRI) study with a stochastic decision-making task in which a stimulus-action-reward association must be learned. A simple reinforcement learning model not only reproduced the subject's action selections reasonably well but also allowed us to quantitatively estimate each subject's temporal profiles of stimulus-action-reward association and reward-prediction error during learning trials. These two internal representations were used in the fMRI correlation analysis. The results revealed that neural correlates of the stimulus-action-reward association reside in the putamen, whereas a correlation with reward-prediction error was found largely in the caudate nucleus and ventral striatum. These nonuniform spatiotemporal distributions of neural correlates within the dorsal striatum were maintained consistently at various levels of task difficulty, suggesting a functional difference in the dorsal striatum between the putamen and caudate nucleus during stimulus-action-reward association learning.},

title = {Direct Access of Ions to the Squid Stellate Ganglion Giant Synapse by Aortic Perfusion: Effects of Calcium-Free Medium, Lanthanum, and Cadmium},
abstract = {The giant synapse in the squid stellate ganglion has served as a model in the understanding of normal synaptic transmission, but has not been used extensively in the study of changes in external ion concentrations or pharmacological agents. This anomaly is due primarily to the substantial diffusion barrier that exists between the synapse and the bathing medium. The present study describes a technique for the rapid introduction of substances into the synapse by perfusion through the arterial blood supply that improves access by at least 50-fold. This is demonstrated by treat- ments known to block the Ca2+ activated release of transmitter from the nerve terminal: Ca2+-free medium, ~a ~+, and Cd2+. Whereas such treatments take 20 minutes to 3 hours to block transmitter release with bath application, with perfusion they act within a few seconds. The excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) is reduced below action potential threshold in 5 to 22 seconds, and disappears completely in less than a minute. In addition, the use of pressurized O2 to drive the perfusate through the preparation eliminates the need for superfusion with O2 and aids in the long term maintenance of the ganglion. This study confirms the important role of Ca2+ in the release of transmitter at the giant synapse, and opens up this neurobiologically im- portant preparation for ionic and pharmacologic evaluation.},

abstract = {The ability to remember a briefly presented scene depends on a number of factors, such as its saliency, novelty, degree of threat, or behavioral relevance to a task. Here, however, we show that the encoding of a scene into memory may depend not only on what the scene contains but also when it occurs. Participants performed an attentionally demanding target detection task at fixation while also viewing a rapid sequence of full-field photographs of urban and natural scenes. Participants were then tested on whether they recognized a specific scene from the previous sequence. We found that scenes were recognized reliably only when presented concurrently with a target at fixation. This is evidence of a mechanism where traces of a visual scene are automatically encoded into memory at behaviorally relevant points in time regardless of the spatial focus of attention.},

abstract = {The recent upsurge in placebo research has demonstrated the sound neurobiological substrate of a phenomenon once believed to be only patient mystification, or at best a variable to control in clinical trials, bringing about a new awareness of its potential exploitation to the patient's benefit and framing it as a positive context effect, with the power to influence the therapy outcome. Placebo effects have been described both in the experimental setting and in different clinical conditions, many of which are of neurological interest. Multiple mechanisms have been described, namely conditioning and cognitive factors like expectation, desire, and reward. A body of evidence from neurochemical, pharmacological, and neuroimaging studies points to the involvement of neural pathways specific to single conditions, such as the activation of the endogenous antinociceptive system during placebo analgesia or the release of dopamine in the striatum of parkinsonian patients experiencing placebo reduction of motor impairment. The possible clinical applications of placebo studies range from the design of clinical trials incorporating specific recommendations and minimizing the use of placebo arms to the optimization of the context surrounding the patient, in order to maximize the placebo component present in any treatment.},

Because the number of potential reward values is very large, it is necessary that the brain's limited resources be allocated so as to discriminate better among more likely reward outcomes at the expense of less likely outcomes. We found that midbrain dopamine neurons rapidly adapted to the information provided by reward-predicting stimuli. Responses shifted relative to the expected reward value, and the gain adjusted to the variance of reward value. In this way, dopamine neurons maintained their reward sensitivity over a large range of reward values.},

title = {Optimal habits can develop spontaneously through sensitivity to local cost},
abstract = {Habits and rituals are expressed universally across animal species. These behaviors are advantageous in allowing sequential behaviors to be performed without cognitive overload, and appear to rely on neural circuits that are relatively benign but vulnerable to takeover by extreme contexts, neuropsychiatric sequelae, and processes leading to addiction. Reinforcement learning (RL) is thought to underlie the formation of optimal habits. However, this theoretic formulation has principally been tested experimentally in simple stimulus-response tasks with relatively few available responses. We asked whether RL could also account for the emergence of habitual action sequences in realistically complex situations in which no repetitive stimulus-response links were present and in which many response options were present. We exposed na{\"\i}ve macaque monkeys to such experimental conditions by introducing a unique free saccade scan task. Despite the highly uncertain conditions and no instruction, the monkeys developed a succession of stereotypical, self-chosen saccade sequence patterns. Remarkably, these continued to morph for months, long after session-averaged reward and cost (eye movement distance) reached asymptote. Prima facie, these continued behavioral changes appeared to challenge RL. However, trial-by-trial analysis showed that pattern changes on adjacent trials were predicted by lowered cost, and RL simulations that reduced the cost reproduced the monkeys' behavior. Ultimately, the patterns settled into stereotypical saccade sequences that minimized the cost of obtaining the reward on average. These findings suggest that brain mechanisms underlying the emergence of habits, and perhaps unwanted repetitive behaviors in clinical disorders, could follow RL algorithms capturing extremely local explore/exploit tradeoffs.},

Single-unit recording and lesion studies in experimental animals have implicated a number of regions in response to reinforcing stimuli, in particular regions of the extended limbic system and the ventral striatum. In this experiment, functional neuroimaging was used to assess neural response within human reward systems under different psychological contexts. Nine healthy volunteers were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging during the performance of a gambling task with financial rewards and penalties. We demonstrated neural sensitivity of midbrain and ventral striatal regions to financial rewards and hippocampal sensitivity to financial penalties. Furthermore, we show that neural responses in globus pallidus, thalamus, and subgenual cingulate were specific to high reward levels occurring in the context of increasing reward. Responses to both reward level in the context of increasing reward and penalty level in the context of increasing penalty were seen in caudate, insula, and ventral prefrontal cortex. These results demonstrate dissociable neural responses to rewards and penalties that are dependent on the psychological context in which they are experienced.},

abstract = {Independent component analysis (ICA) of fMRI data generates session/individual specific brain activation maps without a priori assumptions regarding the timing or pattern of the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal responses. However, because of a random permutation among output components, ICA does not offer a straightforward solution for the inference of group-level activation. In this study, we present an independent vector analysis (IVA) method to address the permutation problem during fMRI group data analysis. In comparison to ICA, IVA offers an analysis of additional dependent components, which were assigned for use in the automated grouping of dependent activation patterns across subjects. Upon testing using simulated trial-based fMRI data, our proposed method was applied to real fMRI data employing both a single-trial task-paradigm (right hand motor clenching and internal speech generation tasks) and a three-trial task-paradigm (right hand motor imagery task). A generalized linear model (GLM) and the group ICA of the fMRI toolbox (GIFT) were also applied to the same data set for comparison to IVA. Compared to GLM, IVA successfully captured activation patterns even when the functional areas showed variable hemodynamic responses that deviated from a hypothesized response. We also showed that IVA effectively inferred group-activation patterns of unknown origins without the requirement for a pre-processing stage (such as data concatenation in ICA-based GIFT). IVA can be used as a potential alternative or an adjunct to current ICA-based fMRI group processing methods.},

title = {Learning and memory functions of the Basal Ganglia},
abstract = {Although the mammalian basal ganglia have long been implicated in motor behavior, it is generally recognized that the behavioral functions of this subcortical group of structures are not exclusively motoric in nature. Extensive evidence now indicates a role for the basal ganglia, in particular the dorsal striatum, in learning and memory. One prominent hypothesis is that this brain region mediates a form of learning in which stimulus-response (S-R) associations or habits are incrementally acquired. Support for this hypothesis is provided by numerous neurobehavioral studies in different mammalian species, including rats, monkeys, and humans. In rats and monkeys, localized brain lesion and pharmacological approaches have been used to examine the role of the basal ganglia in S-R learning. In humans, study of patients with neurodegenerative diseases that compromise the basal ganglia, as well as research using brain neuroimaging techniques, also provide evidence of a role for the basal ganglia in habit learning. Several of these studies have dissociated the role of the basal ganglia in S-R learning from those of a cognitive or declarative medial temporal lobe memory system that includes the hippocampus as a primary component. Evidence suggests that during learning, basal ganglia and medial temporal lobe memory systems are activated simultaneously and that in some learning situations competitive interference exists between these two systems.},

abstract = {The neurological symptoms of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) are assumed to result from the neurotransmitter changes in this disorder. Among them, the dopaminergic system is believed to play a role in the self-injurious behavior through receptor supersensitivity. However, the precise mechanism underlying the dopamine supersensitivity remains unclear. An increased serotonergic action in the striatum may be crucial for the appearance of self-injurious behavior, and pharmacological evidence suggests the efficacy of serotonin agonists/antagonists for the treatment of the self-mutilation in LNS.},

abstract = {Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons fire in 2 characteristic modes, tonic and phasic, which are thought to modulate distinct aspects of behavior. However, the inability to selectively disrupt these patterns of activity has hampered the precise definition of the function of these modes of signaling. Here, we addressed the role of phasic DA in learning and other DA-dependent behaviors by attenuating DA neuron burst firing and subsequent DA release, without altering tonic neural activity. Disruption of phasic DA was achieved by selective genetic inactivation of NMDA-type, ionotropic glutamate receptors in DA neurons. Disruption of phasic DA neuron activity impaired the acquisition of numerous conditioned behavioral responses, and dramatically attenuated learning about cues that predicted rewarding and aversive events while leaving many other DA-dependent behaviors unaffected.},

abstract = {Psychosis is linked to dysregulation of the neuromodulator dopamine and antipsychotic drugs (APDs) work by blocking dopamine receptors. Dopamine-modulated disruption of latent inhibition (LI) and conditioned avoidance response (CAR) have served as standard animal models of psychosis and antipsychotic action, respectively. Meanwhile, the 'temporal difference' algorithm (TD) has emerged as the leading computational model of dopamine neuron firing. In this report TD is extended to include action at the level of dopamine receptors in order to explain a number of behavioral phenomena including the dose-dependent disruption of CAR by APDs, the temporal dissociation of the effects of APDs on receptors vs behavior, the facilitation of LI by APDs, and the disruption of LI by amphetamine. The model also predicts an APD-induced change to the latency profile of CAR--a novel prediction that is verified experimentally. The model's primary contribution is to link dopamine neuron firing, receptor manipulation, and behavior within a common formal framework that may offer insights into clinical observations.},

abstract = {The behavioral functions of rewards comprise the induction of learning and approach behavior. Rewards are not only related to vegetative states of hunger, thirst and reproduction but may also consist of visual stimuli. The present experiment tested the reward potential of different types of still and moving pictures in three operant tasks involving key press, touch of computer monitor and choice behavior in a laboratory environment. We found that all tested visual stimuli induced approach behavior in all three tasks, and that action movies sustained consistently higher rates of responding compared to changing still pictures, which were more effective than constant still pictures. These results demonstrate that visual stimuli can serve as positive reinforcers for operant reactions of animals in controlled laboratory settings. In particular, the coherently animated visual stimuli of movies have considerable reward potential. These observations would allow similar forms of visual rewards to be used for neurophysiological investigations of mechanisms related to non-vegetative rewards.},

title = {Defining the neural mechanisms of probabilistic reversal learning using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging},
abstract = {Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure blood oxygenation level-dependent responses in 13 young healthy human volunteers during performance of a probabilistic reversal-learning task. The task allowed the separate investigation of the relearning of stimulus-reward associations and the reception of negative feedback. Significant signal change in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex was demonstrated on trials when subjects stopped responding to the previously relevant stimulus and shifted responding to the newly relevant stimulus. Significant signal change in the region of the ventral striatum was also observed on such reversal errors, from a region of interest analysis. The ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum were not significantly activated by the other, preceding reversal errors, or when subjects received negative feedback for correct responses. Moreover, the response on the final reversal error, before shifting, was not modulated by the number of preceding reversal errors, indicating that error-related activity does not simply accumulate in this network. The signal change in this ventral frontostriatal circuit is therefore associated with reversal learning and is uncontaminated by negative feedback. Overall, these data concur with findings in rodents and nonhuman primates of reversal-learning deficits after damage to ventral frontostriatal circuitry, and also support recent clinical findings using this task.},

title = {Dissociating hippocampal versus basal ganglia contributions to learning and transfer},
abstract = {Based on prior animal and computational models, we propose a double dissociation between the associative learning deficits observed in patients with medial temporal (hippocampal) damage versus patients with Parkinson's disease (basal ganglia dysfunction). Specifically, we expect that basal ganglia dysfunction may result in slowed learning, while individuals with hippocampal damage may learn at normal speed. However, when challenged with a transfer task where previously learned information is presented in novel recombinations, we expect that hippocampal damage will impair generalization but basal ganglia dysfunction will not. We tested this prediction in a group of healthy elderly with mild-to-moderate hippocampal atrophy, a group of patients with mild Parkinson's disease, and healthy controls, using an "acquired equivalence" associative learning task. As predicted, Parkinson's patients were slower on the initial learning but then transferred well, while the hippocampal atrophy group showed the opposite pattern: good initial learning with impaired transfer. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a single task has been used to demonstrate a double dissociation between the associative learning impairments caused by hippocampal versus basal ganglia damage/dysfunction. This finding has implications for understanding the distinct contributions of the medial temporal lobe and basal ganglia to learning and memory.},

abstract = {Cue-elicited phasic changes in firing of nucleus accumbens (NAc) neurons can facilitate reward-seeking behavior. Here, we test the hypothesis that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which sends a dense glutamatergic projection to the NAc core, contributes to NAc neuronal firing responses to reward-predictive cues. Rats trained to perform an operant response to a cue for sucrose were implanted with recording electrodes in the core of the NAc and microinjection cannulas in the dorsal mPFC (dmPFC). The cue-evoked firing of NAc neurons was reduced by bilateral injection of GABA(A) and GABA(B) agonists into the dmPFC concomitant with loss of behavioral responding to the cue. In addition, unilateral dmPFC inactivation reduced ipsilateral cue excitations and contralateral cue inhibitions. These findings indicate that cue-evoked excitations and inhibitions of NAc core neurons depend on dmPFC projections to the NAc and that these phasic changes contribute to the behavioral response to reward-predictive cues.},

title = {Striatal contributions to reward and decision making: making sense of regional variations in a reiterated processing matrix},
abstract = {The striatum is the major input nucleus of the basal ganglia. It is thought to play a key role in learning on the basis of positive reinforcement and in action selection. One view of the striatum conceives it as comprising a reiterated matrix of processing units that perform common operations in different striatal regions, namely synaptic plasticity according to a three-factor rule, and lateral inhibition. These operations are required for reinforcement learning and selection of previously reinforced actions. Analysis of the behavioral effects of circumscribed lesions of the striatum, however, suggests regional specialization of learning and decision-making operations. We consider how a basic processing unit may be modified by regional variations in neurochemical parameters, for example, by the gradient in density of dopamine terminals from dorsal to ventral striatum. These variations suggest subtle differences between dorsolateral and ventromedial striatal regions in the temporal properties of dopamine signaling, which are superimposed on regional differences in connectivity. We propose that these variations make sense in relation to the temporal structure of activity in striatal inputs from different regions, and the requirements of different learning operations. Dorsolateral striatal (DLS) regions may be subject to brief, precisely timed pulses of dopamine, whereas ventromedial striatal regions integrate dopamine signals over a longer time course. These differences may be important for understanding regional variations in the contribution to reinforcement of habits, versus incentive processes that are sensitive to the value of expected rewards.},

title = {Dissociation between striatal regions while learning to categorize via feedback and via observation},
abstract = {Convergent evidence from functional imaging and from neuropsychological studies of basal ganglia disorders indicates that the striatum is involved in learning to categorize visual stimuli with feedback. However, it is unclear which cognitive process or processes involved in categorization is or are responsible for striatal recruitment; different regions of the striatum have been linked to feedback processing and to acquisition of stimulus-category associations. We examined the effect of the presence of feedback during learning on striatal recruitment by comparing feedback learning with observational learning of an information integration task. In the feedback task, participants were shown a stimulus, made a button press response, and then received feedback as to whether they had made the correct response. In the observational task, participants were given the category label before the stimulus appeared and then made a button press indicating the correct category membership. A region-of-interest analysis was used to examine activity in three regions of the striatum: the head of the caudate, body and tail of the caudate, and the putamen. Activity in the left head of the caudate was modulated by the presence of feedback: The magnitude of activation change was greater during feedback learning than during observational learning. In contrast, the bilateral body and tail of the caudate and the putamen were active to a similar degree in both feedback and observational learning. This pattern of results supports a functional dissociation between regions of the striatum, such that the head of the caudate is involved in feedback processing, whereas the body and tail of the caudate and the putamen are involved in learning stimulus-category associations. The hippocampus was active bilaterally during both feedback and observational learning, indicating potential parallel involvement with the striatum in information integration category learning.},

title = {Neural correlates of response reversal: considering acquisition},
abstract = {Previous work on response reversal has typically used a single pair of stimuli that serially reverse. This conflation of acquisition and reversal processes has prevented an examination of the functional role of neural systems implicated in response reversal during acquisition despite the relevance of such data in evaluating accounts of response reversal. In the current study, participants encountered 16 independent reversing stimulus pairs in the context of a probabilistic response reversal paradigm. Functional regions of interest identified as involved in response reversal through a contrast used in the previous literature (punished errors made in the reversal phase versus rewarded correct responses), were interrogated across conditions. Consistent with suggestions that middle frontal cortex codes reward, this region showed significantly greater responses to rewarded rather than punished trials irrespective of accuracy or learning phase (acquisition or reversal). Consistent with the suggestion that this coding of the expectation of reinforcement is acquired via input from the amygdala, we observed significant positive connectivity between activity within the amygdala and a region of rostral anterior cingulate cortex highly proximal to this region of middle frontal/mesial prefrontal cortex. In contrast, inferior frontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and caudate showed greater responses to punished errors than to the rewarded correct responses. These three regions also showed significant activation to rewarded errors during acquisition, in contrast to positions suggesting that inferior frontal cortex represents punishment or suppresses previously rewarded responses. Moreover, a connectivity analysis with an anterior cingulate cortex seed revealed highly significant positive connectivity among them. The implications of these data for recent accounts of response reversal and of response reversal impairments in specific neuropsychiatric populations are discussed.},

title = {Characterizing the hemodynamic response: effects of presentation rate, sampling procedure, and the possibility of ordering brain activity based on relative timing},
abstract = {Rapid-presentation event-related functional MRI (ER-fMRI) allows neuroimaging methods based on hemodynamics to employ behavioral task paradigms typical of cognitive settings. However, the sluggishness of the hemodynamic response and its variance provide constraints on how ER-fMRI can be applied. In a series of two studies, estimates of the hemodynamic response in or near the primary visual and motor cortices were compared across various paradigms and sampling procedures to determine the limits of ER-fMRI procedures and, more generally, to describe the behavior of the hemodynamic response. The temporal profile of the hemodynamic response was estimated across overlapping events by solving a set of linear equations within the general linear model. No assumptions about the shape were made in solving the equations. Following estimation of the temporal profile, the amplitude and timing were modeled using a gamma function. Results indicated that (1) within a region, for a given subject, estimation of the hemodynamic response is extremely stable for both amplitude (r(2) = 0.98) and time to peak (r(2) = 0.95), from one series of measurements to the next, and slightly less stable for estimation of time to onset (r(2) = 0.60). (2) As the trial presentation rate changed (from those spaced 20 s apart to temporally overlapping trials), the hemodynamic response amplitude showed a small, but significant, decrease. Trial onsets spaced (on average) 5 s apart showed a 17-25% reduction in amplitude compared to those spaced 20 s apart. Power analysis indicated that the increased number of trials at fast rates outweighs this decrease in amplitude if statistically reliable response detection is the goal. (3) Knowledge of the amplitude and timing of the hemodynamic response in one region failed to predict those properties in another region, even for within-subject comparisons. (4) Across subjects, the amplitude of the response showed no significant correlation with timing of the response, for either time-to-onset or time-to-peak estimates. (5) The within-region stability of the response was sufficient to allow offsets in the timing of the response to be detected that were under a second, placing event-related fMRI methods in a position to answer questions about the change in relative timing between regions.},

title = {On the use of information theory for the analysis of the relationship between neural and imaging signals},
abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a widely used method for studying the neural basis of cognition and of sensory function. A potential problem in the interpretation of fMRI data is that fMRI measures neural activity only indirectly, as a local change of deoxyhemoglobin concentration due to the metabolic demands of neural function. To build correct sensory and cognitive maps in the human brain, it is thus crucial to understand whether fMRI and neural activity convey the same type of information about external correlates. While a substantial experimental effort has been devoted to the simultaneous recordings of hemodynamic and neural signals, so far, the development of analysis methods that elucidate how neural and hemodynamic signals represent sensory information has received less attention. In this article, we critically review why the analytical framework of information theory, the mathematical theory of communication, is ideally suited to this purpose. We review the principles of information theory and explain how they could be applied to the analysis of fMRI and neural signals. We show that a critical advantage of information theory over more traditional analysis paradigms commonly used in the fMRI literature is that it can elucidate, within a single framework, whether an empirically observed correlation between neural and fMRI signals reflects either a similar stimulus tuning or a common source of variability unrelated to the external stimuli. In addition, information theory determines the extent to which these shared sources of stimulus signal and of variability lead fMRI and neural signals to convey similar information about external correlates. We then illustrate the formalism by applying it to the analysis of the information carried by different bands of the local field potential. We conclude by discussing the current methodological challenges that need to be addressed to make the information-theoretic approach more robustly applicable to the simultaneous recordings of neural and imaging data.},

abstract = {Reward from a particular action is seldom immediate, and the influence of such delayed outcome on choice decreases with delay. It has been postulated that when faced with immediate and delayed rewards, decision makers choose the option with maximum temporally discounted value. We examined the preference of monkeys for delayed reward in an intertemporal choice task and the neural basis for real-time computation of temporally discounted values in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. During this task, the locations of the targets associated with small or large rewards and their corresponding delays were randomly varied. We found that prefrontal neurons often encoded the temporally discounted value of reward expected from a particular option. Furthermore, activity tended to increase when discounted values for targets were presented in the neuron's preferred direction, suggesting that activity related to temporally discounted values in the prefrontal cortex might determine the animal's behavior during intertemporal choice.},

In this sort of linear adjustment paradigm animal are biased towards previous choices (more-or-less indep of R values).

Also previous studies have seen discounting activity after choice in avain PFc and OFC (rat).

Discounting is often hyperbolic, not base(e) exponential.

Focus on the DLPFC (contextual control, decision making)

" The results from the present study show that many neurons in the DLPFC changed their activity similarly when the magnitude of reward from a particular target decreased and when the same reward was delayed, suggesting that DLPFC encodes the temporally discounted value of reward expected from a particular choice. "

"All three animals chose the small-reward target more frequently as the delay for the small reward decreased and as the delay for the large reward increased (Figures 1C and 1D), indicating that their preference for delayed reward was systematically influenced by the information about the reward delays extracted from the clocks. In addition, their choice behaviors were better accounted for by a hyperbolic discount function than by an exponential discount function. "

title = {Response processes in information-integration category learning},
abstract = {Much recent evidence suggests that human category learning is mediated by multiple systems. Evidence suggests that at least one of these depends on procedural learning within the basal ganglia. Information-integration categorization tasks are thought to load heavily on this procedural-learning system. The results of several previous studies were interpreted to suggest that response positions are learned in information-integration tasks. This hypothesis was tested in two experiments. Experiment 1 showed that information-integration category learning was slowed but not disrupted when the spatial location of the responses varied randomly across trials. Experiment 2 showed that information-integration learning was impaired if category membership was signaled by responding to a Yes/No question and the category label had no consistent spatial location. These results suggest that information-integration category learning does not require consistent response locations. In these experiments, a consistent association between a category and a response feature was sufficient. The implication of these results for the neurobiology of information-integration category learning is discussed.},

title = {Comparison of learning-related neuronal activity in the dorsal premotor cortex and striatum},
abstract = {Previous studies have reported learning-related changes in neuronal activity during conditional visuomotor learning, also known as arbitrary sensorimotor mapping, conditional visual discrimination, and symbolic or endogenous mapping. Qualitatively similar observations have been reported for the dorsal premotor cortex, the supplementary eye field, the prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus, the striatum and the globus pallidus. The fact that cells in both the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) and the basal ganglia show changes in activity during associative learning enables a test of the hypothesis that cortex and basal ganglia function in distributed architectures known as cortical-basal ganglionic modules or 'loops'. We reasoned that if these loops represent functional entities, as proposed, then learning-related changes in activity should occur simultaneously in both the cortical and striatal nodes of a loop. The present results confirmed this prediction; as monkeys learned conditional visuomotor associations, neurons in the premotor cortex and associated parts of the putamen changed their rates at approximately the same time. For the largest number of neurons, the evolution in neural activity occurred in close correspondence to the monkeys' learning curves. As a population, however, learning-related changes in activity continued after the monkeys reached an asymptote in performance.},

title = {Dissociating the contributions of independent corticostriatal systems to visual categorization learning through the use of reinforcement learning modeling and Granger causality modeling},
abstract = {We dissociated the contributions to learning of four corticostriatal "loops" (interacting striatal and cortical regions): motor (putamen and motor cortex), visual (posterior caudate and visual cortex), executive (anterior caudate and prefrontal cortex), and motivational (ventral striatum and ventromedial frontal cortex). Subjects learned to categorize individual repeated images into one of two arbitrary categories via trial and error. We identified (1) regions sensitive to correct categorization, categorization learning, and feedback valence; (2) regions sensitive to prediction error (violation of feedback expectancy) and reward prediction (expected feedback associated with category response) using reinforcement learning modeling; and (3) directed influences between regions using Granger causality modeling. Each loop showed a unique pattern of sensitivity to each of these factors. Both the motor and visual loops were involved in acquisition of categorization ability: activity during correct categorization increased across learning and was sensitive to reward prediction. However, the posterior caudate received directed influence from visual cortex, whereas the putamen exerted directed influence on motor cortex. The motivational and executive loops were involved in feedback processing: both regions were sensitive to feedback valence, which interacted with learning across scans. However, the motivational loop activity reflected prediction error, whereas executive loop activity reflected reward prediction, consistent with the executive loop role in integrating reward and action. Granger causality modeling found directed influences between striatal and cortical regions within each loop. Across loops, the motor loop exerted directed influence on the executive loop which is consistent with the role of the executive loop in integrating feedback with stimulus-response history.},

title = {A dual role for prediction error in associative learning},
abstract = {Confronted with a rich sensory environment, the brain must learn statistical regularities across sensory domains to construct causal models of the world. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to furnish neurophysiological evidence that statistical associations are learnt, even when task-irrelevant. Subjects performed an audio-visual target-detection task while being exposed to distractor stimuli. Unknown to them, auditory distractors predicted the presence or absence of subsequent visual distractors. We modeled incidental learning of these associations using a Rescorla-Wagner (RW) model. Activity in primary visual cortex and putamen reflected learning-dependent surprise: these areas responded progressively more to unpredicted, and progressively less to predicted visual stimuli. Critically, this prediction-error response was observed even when the absence of a visual stimulus was surprising. We investigated the underlying mechanism by embedding the RW model into a DCM to show that auditory to visual connectivity changed significantly over time as a function of prediction error. Thus, consistent with predictive coding models of perception, associative learning is mediated by prediction-error dependent changes in connectivity. These results posit a dual role for prediction-error in encoding surprise and driving associative plasticity.},

title = {Prediction error for free monetary reward in the human prefrontal cortex},
abstract = {Making predictions about future rewards is an important ability for primates, and its neurophysiological mechanisms have been studied extensively. One important approach is to identify neural systems that process errors related to reward prediction (i.e., areas that register the occurrence of unpredicted rewards and the failure of expected rewards). In monkeys that have learned to predict appetitive rewards during reward-directed behaviors, dopamine neurons reliably signal both types of prediction error. The mechanisms in the human brain involved in processing prediction error for monetary rewards are not well understood. Furthermore, nothing is known of how such systems operate when rewards are not contingent on behavior. We used event-related fMRI to localize responses to both classes of prediction error. Subjects were able to predict a monetary reward or a nonreward on the basis of a prior visual cue. On occasional trials, cue-outcome contingencies were reversed (unpredicted rewards and failure of expected rewards). Subjects were not required to make decisions or actions. We compared each type of prediction error trial with its corresponding control trial in which the same prediction did not fail. Each type of prediction error evoked activity in a distinct frontotemporal circuit. Unexpected reward failure evoked activity in the temporal cortex and frontal pole (area 10). Unpredicted rewards evoked activity in the orbitofrontal cortex, the frontal pole, parahippocampal cortex, and cerebellum. Activity time-locked to prediction errors in frontotemporal circuits suggests that they are involved in encoding the associations between visual cues and monetary rewards in the human brain.},

title = {The role of emotion in decision-making: evidence from neurological patients with orbitofrontal damage},
abstract = {Most theories of choice assume that decisions derive from an assessment of the future outcomes of various options and alternatives through some type of cost-benefit analyses. The influence of emotions on decision-making is largely ignored. The studies of decision-making in neurological patients who can no longer process emotional information normally suggest that people make judgments not only by evaluating the consequences and their probability of occurring, but also and even sometimes primarily at a gut or emotional level. Lesions of the ventromedial (which includes the orbitofrontal) sector of the prefrontal cortex interfere with the normal processing of "somatic" or emotional signals, while sparing most basic cognitive functions. Such damage leads to impairments in the decision-making process, which seriously compromise the quality of decisions in daily life. The aim of this paper is to review evidence in support of "The Somatic Marker Hypothesis," which provides a systems-level neuroanatomical and cognitive framework for decision-making and suggests that the process of decision-making depends in many important ways on neural substrates that regulate homeostasis, emotion, and feeling. The implications of this theoretical framework for the normal and abnormal development of the orbitofrontal cortex are also discussed.},

title = {Threshold-free cluster enhancement: addressing problems of smoothing, threshold dependence and localisation in cluster inference},
abstract = {Many image enhancement and thresholding techniques make use of spatial neighbourhood information to boost belief in extended areas of signal. The most common such approach in neuroimaging is cluster-based thresholding, which is often more sensitive than voxel-wise thresholding. However, a limitation is the need to define the initial cluster-forming threshold. This threshold is arbitrary, and yet its exact choice can have a large impact on the results, particularly at the lower (e.g., t, z < 4) cluster-forming thresholds frequently used. Furthermore, the amount of spatial pre-smoothing is also arbitrary (given that the expected signal extent is very rarely known in advance of the analysis). In the light of such problems, we propose a new method which attempts to keep the sensitivity benefits of cluster-based thresholding (and indeed the general concept of "clusters" of signal), while avoiding (or at least minimising) these problems. The method takes a raw statistic image and produces an output image in which the voxel-wise values represent the amount of cluster-like local spatial support. The method is thus referred to as "threshold-free cluster enhancement" (TFCE). We present the TFCE approach and discuss in detail ROC-based optimisation and comparisons with cluster-based and voxel-based thresholding. We find that TFCE gives generally better sensitivity than other methods over a wide range of test signal shapes and SNR values. We also show an example on a real imaging dataset, suggesting that TFCE does indeed provide not just improved sensitivity, but richer and more interpretable output than cluster-based thresholding.},

title = {Cortical and striatal contributions to automaticity in information-integration categorization},
abstract = {In information-integration categorization, accuracy is maximized only if information from two or more stimulus components is integrated at some pre-decisional stage. In many cases the optimal strategy is difficult or impossible to describe verbally. Evidence suggests that success in information-integration tasks depends on procedural learning that is mediated largely within the striatum. Although many studies have examined initial information-integration learning, little is known about how automaticity develops in information-integration tasks. To address this issue, each of ten human participants received feedback training on the same information-integration categories for more than 11,000 trials spread over 20 different training sessions. Sessions 2, 4, 10, and 20 were performed inside an MRI scanner. The following results stood out. 1) Automaticity developed between sessions 10 and 20. 2) Pre-automatic performance depended on the putamen, but not on the body and tail of the caudate nucleus. 3) Automatic performance depended only on cortical regions, particularly the supplementary and pre-supplementary motor areas. 4) Feedback processing was mainly associated with deactivations in motor and premotor regions of cortex, and in the ventral lateral prefrontal cortex. 5) The overall effects of practice were consistent with the existing literature on the development of automaticity.},

abstract = {We studied the choice behavior of 2 monkeys in a discrete-trial task with reinforcement contingencies similar to those Herrnstein (1961) used when he described the matching law. In each session, the monkeys experienced blocks of discrete trials at different relative-reinforcer frequencies or magnitudes with unsignalled transitions between the blocks. Steady-state data following adjustment to each transition were well characterized by the generalized matching law; response ratios undermatched reinforcer frequency ratios but matched reinforcer magnitude ratios. We modelled response-by-response behavior with linear models that used past reinforcers as well as past choices to predict the monkeys' choices on each trial. We found that more recently obtained reinforcers more strongly influenced choice behavior. Perhaps surprisingly, we also found that the monkeys' actions were influenced by the pattern of their own past choices. It was necessary to incorporate both past reinforcers and past choices in order to accurately capture steady-state behavior as well as the fluctuations during block transitions and the response-by-response patterns of behavior. Our results suggest that simple reinforcement learning models must account for the effects of past choices to accurately characterize behavior in this task, and that models with these properties provide a conceptual tool for studying how both past reinforcers and past choices are integrated by the neural systems that generate behavior.},

In addition to making predictions for normal human adults, the theory makes specific predictions for children, elderly people, and patients suffering from Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, major depression, amnesia, or lesions of the prefrontal cortex. Two separate formal descriptions of the theory are also provided. One describes trial-by-trial learning, and the other describes global dynamics.

However, there has been a persistent concern as to whether the high-resolution fMRI signals actually mark the sites of increased neural activity. To examine this outstanding issue, the authors used iso-orientation columns of isoflurane-anesthetized cats as a biological model and confirmed the neural correlation of fMRI iso-orientation maps by comparing them with intrinsic optical imaging maps. The results suggest that highest fMRI signals indeed indicate the sites of increased neuronal activity. Now fMRI can be used to determine plastic and/or developmental change of functional columnar structure possibly on a layer-to-layer basis. In this review, the authors focus mainly on what technical aspects should be considered when mapping functional cortical columns, including imaging techniques and experimental design.},

title = {Decoding the neural substrates of reward-related decision making with functional MRI},
abstract = {Although previous studies have implicated a diverse set of brain regions in reward-related decision making, it is not yet known which of these regions contain information that directly reflects a decision. Here, we measured brain activity using functional MRI in a group of subjects while they performed a simple reward-based decision-making task: probabilistic reversal-learning. We recorded brain activity from nine distinct regions of interest previously implicated in decision making and separated out local spatially distributed signals in each region from global differences in signal. Using a multivariate analysis approach, we determined the extent to which global and local signals could be used to decode subjects' subsequent behavioral choice, based on their brain activity on the preceding trial. We found that subjects' decisions could be decoded to a high level of accuracy on the basis of both local and global signals even before they were required to make a choice, and even before they knew which physical action would be required. Furthermore, the combined signals from three specific brain areas (anterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and ventral striatum) were found to provide all of the information sufficient to decode subjects' decisions out of all of the regions we studied. These findings implicate a specific network of regions in encoding information relevant to subsequent behavioral choice.},

However, uncertainty monitoring and control have not been studied in multi-dimensional, information-integration categorization tasks that rely on non-declarative procedural memory. Three experiments are described that investigated the human uncertainty response in such tasks. Experiment 1 showed that following standard categorization training, uncertainty responding was similar in information-integration tasks and rule-based tasks requiring declarative memory. In Experiment 2, however, uncertainty responding in untrained information-integration tasks impaired the ability of many participants to master those tasks. Finally, Experiment 3 showed that the deficit observed in Experiment 2 was not because of the uncertainty response option per se, but rather because the uncertainty response provided participants a mechanism via which to eliminate stimuli that were inconsistent with a simple declarative response strategy.

We investigated the neural basis of the WTP computation by scanning hungry subjects' brains using functional magnetic resonance imaging while they placed real bids for the right to eat different foods.

abstract = {The potential for human neuroimaging to read out the detailed contents of a person's mental state has yet to be fully explored. We investigated whether the perception of edge orientation, a fundamental visual feature, can be decoded from human brain activity measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Using statistical algorithms to classify brain states, we found that ensemble fMRI signals in early visual areas could reliably predict on individual trials which of eight stimulus orientations the subject was seeing. Moreover, when subjects had to attend to one of two overlapping orthogonal gratings, feature-based attention strongly biased ensemble activity toward the attended orientation. These results demonstrate that fMRI activity patterns in early visual areas, including primary visual cortex (V1), contain detailed orientation information that can reliably predict subjective perception. Our approach provides a framework for the readout of fine-tuned representations in the human brain and their subjective contents.},

title = {Role of brain dopamine in food reward and reinforcement},
abstract = {The ability of food to establish and maintain response habits and conditioned preferences depends largely on the function of brain dopamine systems. While dopaminergic transmission in the nucleus accumbens appears sufficient for some forms of reward, the role of dopamine in food reward does not appear to be restricted to this region. Dopamine plays an important role in both the ability to energize feeding and to reinforce food-seeking behaviour; the role in energizing feeding is secondary to the prerequisite role in reinforcement. Dopaminergic activation is triggered by the auditory and visual as well as the tactile, olfactory, and gustatory stimuli of foods. While dopamine plays a central role in the feeding and food-seeking of normal animals, some food rewarded learning can be seen in genetically engineered dopamine-deficient mice.},

title = {Risk-dependent reward value signal in human prefrontal cortex},
abstract = {When making choices under uncertainty, people usually consider both the expected value and risk of each option, and choose the one with the higher utility. Expected value increases the expected utility of an option for all individuals. Risk increases the utility of an option for risk-seeking individuals, but decreases it for risk averse individuals. In 2 separate experiments, one involving imperative (no-choice), the other choice situations, we investigated how predicted risk and expected value aggregate into a common reward signal in the human brain. Blood oxygen level dependent responses in lateral regions of the prefrontal cortex increased monotonically with increasing reward value in the absence of risk in both experiments. Risk enhanced these responses in risk-seeking participants, but reduced them in risk-averse participants. The aggregate value and risk responses in lateral prefrontal cortex contrasted with pure value signals independent of risk in the striatum. These results demonstrate an aggregate risk and value signal in the prefrontal cortex that would be compatible with basic assumptions underlying the mean-variance approach to utility.},

title = {Trial-by-trial fluctuations in the event-related electroencephalogram reflect dynamic changes in the degree of surprise},
abstract = {The P300 component of the human event-related brain potential has often been linked to the processing of rare, surprising events. However, the formal computational processes underlying the generation of the P300 are not well known. Here, we formulate a simple model of trial-by-trial learning of stimulus probabilities based on Information Theory. Specifically, we modeled the surprise associated with the occurrence of a visual stimulus to provide a formal quantification of the "subjective probability" associated with an event. Subjects performed a choice reaction time task, while we recorded their brain responses using electroencephalography (EEG). In each of 12 blocks, the probabilities of stimulus occurrence were changed, thereby creating sequences of trials with low, medium, and high predictability. Trial-by-trial variations in the P300 component were best explained by a model of stimulus-bound surprise. This model accounted for the data better than a categorical model that parametrically encoded the stimulus identity, or an alternative model of surprise based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The present data demonstrate that trial-by-trial changes in P300 can be explained by predictions made by an ideal observer keeping track of the probabilities of possible events. This provides evidence for theories proposing a direct link between the P300 component and the processing of surprising events. Furthermore, this study demonstrates how model-based analyses can be used to explain significant proportions of the trial-by-trial changes in human event-related EEG responses.},

title = {Random neural networks with synchronized interactions},
abstract = {Large-scale distributed systems, such as natural neuronal and artificial systems, have many local interconnections, but they often also have the ability to propagate information very fast over relatively large distances. Mechanisms that enable such behavior include very long physical signaling paths and possibly saccades of synchronous behavior that may propagate across a network. This letter studies the modeling of such behaviors in neuronal networks and develops a related learning algorithm. This is done in the context of the random neural network (RNN), a probabilistic model with a well-developed mathematical theory, which was inspired by the apparently stochastic spiking behavior of certain natural neuronal systems. Thus, we develop an extension of the RNN to the case when synchronous interactions can occur, leading to synchronous firing by large ensembles of cells. We also present an O(N(3)) gradient descent learning algorithm for an N-cell recurrent network having both conventional excitatory-inhibitory interactions and synchronous interactions. Finally, the model and its learning algorithm are applied to a resource allocation problem that is NP-hard and requires fast approximate decisions.},

abstract = {To interact effectively with our environment, we need to specify the intended outcomes (goals) of our actions. In this process, immediate goals and final goals can be regarded as different levels within a hierarchically organized system for action planning: immediate goals and movement details are selected to accomplish more remote goals. Behavioral studies support this notion of different levels of action planning, but the neurophysiological basis remains unclear. Using fMRI, we examined the neural correlates of preparing object manipulations based on either the desired end-state (the final goal) or the initial movement towards a target (the immediate goal). Subjects had to insert an object (consisting of a large and a small cube) into one of two corresponding large and small slots. The subjects were cued on either which slot to fill (Final Goal trials) or which object part to grasp (Immediate Goal trials). These actions required similar movements, but different planning. During Final Goal trials, there was differential preparatory activity along the superior frontal gyrus (bilaterally) and in left inferior parietal cortex. Immediate Goal trials evoked differential activity in occipito-parietal and occipito-temporal cortex. These findings support the notion that actions can be planned at different levels. We show that different fronto-parietal circuits plan the same action, by a relative emphasis on either selecting a sequence of movements to achieve a desired end-state, or selecting movements spatially compatible with given object properties.},

abstract = {Reward and novelty are potent learning signals that critically rely on dopaminergic midbrain responses. Recent findings suggest that although reward and novelty are likely to interact, both functions may be subserved by distinct neuronal clusters. We used high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to isolate neural responses to reward and novelty within the human substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA) complex to investigate the spatial delineation and integration of reward- and novelty-related activity clusters. We demonstrate that distinct clusters within the caudal portion of the medial SN/VTA and the lateral portion of the right SN are predominantly modulated by the anticipation of reward, while a more rostral part of the medial SN/VTA was exclusively modulated by novelty. In addition, the caudal medial SN/VTA cluster embodied an interaction between novelty and reward where novelty selectively increased reward-anticipation responses. This interaction, in turn, was paralleled by differences in the functional-connectivity patterns of these SN/VTA regions. Specifically, novel as compared to familiar reward-predictive stimuli increased the functional connectivity of the medial SN/VTA with mesolimbic regions, including the nucleus accumbens and the hippocampus, as well as with the primary visual cortex. This functional correlation may highlight how afferents of the medial SN/VTA provide integrative information about novelty and reward, or, alternatively, how medial SN/VTA activity may modulate memory processes for novel events associated with rewards.},

Second, we examined dynamic interactions within and between corticostriatal loops using Granger causality mapping. On each trial, subjects viewed one of six abstract visual stimuli, pressed a button indicating category membership, and then received feedback as to whether the decision was right or wrong.

abstract = {Previous research has suggested that a probabilistic category learning task (e.g. weather prediction task) can be used to elucidate brain substrates of learning. We tested amnesic subjects with bilateral hippocampal damage due to hypoxia and matched controls on the weather prediction task and a variant, the "ice cream" task, which maintains a similar category structure. The hypoxic subjects were impaired relative to controls on both tasks; in the ice cream task, this difference was evident even early in training (first 50 trials). This finding is similar to functional neuroimaging (fMRI) studies in healthy subjects, which show medial temporal involvement even in early learning on this task. Additionally, strategy analysis of response patterns during learning suggest that the hypoxic group relied more heavily on simple, degraded learning strategies than did the control group. These results may suggest a qualification of the generally held conclusion that amnesic patients are not impaired at probabilistic category learning: at least under some circumstances, amnesic patients show an early and lasting deficit.},

title = {Single neurons in prefrontal cortex encode abstract rules},
abstract = {The ability to abstract principles or rules from direct experience allows behaviour to extend beyond specific circumstances to general situations. For example, we learn the 'rules' for restaurant dining from specific experiences and can then apply them in new restaurants. The use of such rules is thought to depend on the prefrontal cortex (PFC) because its damage often results in difficulty in following rules. Here we explore its neural basis by recording from single neurons in the PFC of monkeys trained to use two abstract rules. They were required to indicate whether two successively presented pictures were the same or different depending on which rule was currently in effect. The monkeys performed this task with new pictures, thus showing that they had learned two general principles that could be applied to stimuli that they had not yet experienced. The most prevalent neuronal activity observed in the PFC reflected the coding of these abstract rules.},

title = {How do the basal ganglia contribute to categorization? Their roles in generalization, response selection, and learning via feedback},
abstract = {This article examines how independent corticostriatal loops linking basal ganglia with cerebral cortex contribute to visual categorization. The first aspect of categorization discussed is the role of the visual corticostriatal loop, which connects the visual cortex and the body/tail of the caudate, in mapping visual stimuli to categories, including evaluating the degree to which this loop may generalize across individual category members. The second aspect of categorization discussed is the selection of appropriate actions or behaviors on the basis of category membership, and the role of the visual corticostriatal loop output and the motor corticostriatal loop, which connects motor planning areas with the putamen, in action selection. The third aspect of categorization discussed is how categories are learned with the aid of feedback linked dopaminergic projections to the basal ganglia. These projections underlie corticostriatal synaptic plasticity across the basal ganglia, and also serve as input to the executive and motivational corticostriatal loops that play a role in strategic use of feedback.},

title = {Combining multivariate voxel selection and support vector machines for mapping and classification of fMRI spatial patterns},
abstract = {In functional brain mapping, pattern recognition methods allow detecting multivoxel patterns of brain activation which are informative with respect to a subject's perceptual or cognitive state. The sensitivity of these methods, however, is greatly reduced when the proportion of voxels that convey the discriminative information is small compared to the total number of measured voxels. To reduce this dimensionality problem, previous studies employed univariate voxel selection or region-of-interest-based strategies as a preceding step to the application of machine learning algorithms. Here we employ a strategy for classifying functional imaging data based on a multivariate feature selection algorithm, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) that uses the training algorithm (support vector machine) recursively to eliminate irrelevant voxels and estimate informative spatial patterns. Generalization performances on test data increases while features/voxels are pruned based on their discrimination ability. In this article we evaluate RFE in terms of sensitivity of discriminative maps (Receiver Operative Characteristic analysis) and generalization performances and compare it to previously used univariate voxel selection strategies based on activation and discrimination measures. Using simulated fMRI data, we show that the recursive approach is suitable for mapping discriminative patterns and that the combination of an initial univariate activation-based (F-test) reduction of voxels and multivariate recursive feature elimination produces the best results, especially when differences between conditions have a low contrast-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, we apply our method to high resolution (2 x 2 x 2mm(3)) data from an auditory fMRI experiment in which subjects were stimulated with sounds from four different categories. With these real data, our recursive algorithm proves able to detect and accurately classify multivoxel spatial patterns, highlighting the role of the superior temporal gyrus in encoding the information of sound categories. In line with the simulation results, our method outperforms univariate statistical analysis and statistical learning without feature selection.},

title = {Prefrontal cortex mediation of cognitive enhancement in rewarding motivational contexts},
abstract = {Increasing the reward value of behavioral goals can facilitate cognitive processes required for goal achievement. This facilitation may be accomplished by the dynamic and flexible engagement of cognitive control mechanisms operating in distributed brain regions. It is still not clear, however, what are the characteristics of individuals, situations, and neural activation dynamics that optimize motivation-linked cognitive enhancement. Here we show that highly reward-sensitive individuals exhibited greater improvement of working memory performance in rewarding contexts, but exclusively on trials that were not rewarded. This effect was mediated by a shift in the temporal dynamics of activation within right lateral prefrontal cortex, from a transient to predominantly tonic mode, with an additional anticipatory transient boost. In contexts with intermittent rewards, a strategy of proactive cognitive control may enable globally optimal performance to facilitate reward attainment. Reward-sensitive individuals appear preferentially motivated to adopt this resource-demanding strategy, resulting in paradoxical benefits selectively for nonrewarded events.},

title = {The spatial extent of the BOLD response},
abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging is routinely used to localize brain function, with multiple brain scans averaged together to reveal activation volumes. In this study, we examine the seldom-studied effect of multiple scan averaging on the extent of activation volume. Using restricted visual field stimulation, we obtained a large number of scan repetitions and analyzed changes in activation volume with progressively increased averaging and across single scans. Activation volume increased monotonically with averaging and failed to asymptote when as many as 22 scans were averaged together. Expansions in the spatial extent of activation were not random; rather, they were centered about activation loci that appear with little or no averaging. Using empirical and simulated data, changes with averaging in activation volumes and cross correlation coefficient distributions revealed the presence of considerably more activated voxels than commonly surmised. Many voxels have low SNR and remain undetected without extensive averaging. The primary source of such voxels was not downstream venous drainage since there was no significant and consistent delay difference between voxels activated at different averaging levels. Voxels with low SNR may reflect a diffuse subthreshold activity centered about spiking neurons, dephasing gradients from distal veins, or simply a blood flow response extending beyond the locus of neuronal firing. Across single scans, as much as twofold changes in activation volume were observed. These changes were not correlated with the order of scan acquisition, subject task performance, or signal and noise properties of activated voxels. Instead, they may reflect subtle changes between overlapping noise and signal frequency components.},

In this context kernel methods, e.g., support vector machines (SVM) are frequently adopted to learn statistical relations between patterns of brain activation and experimental conditions. In this paper we focus on visualization of such nonlinear kernel models. Specifically, we investigate the sensitivity map as a technique for generation of global summary maps of kernel classification models. We illustrate the performance of the sensitivity map on functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) data based on visual stimuli. We show that the performance of linear models is reduced for certain scan labelings/categorizations in this data set, while the nonlinear models provide more flexibility. We show that the sensitivity map can be used to visualize nonlinear versions of kernel logistic regression, the kernel Fisher discriminant, and the SVM, and conclude that the sensitivity map is a versatile and computationally efficient tool for visualization of nonlinear kernel models in neuroimaging.},

title = {Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex drives mesolimbic dopaminergic regions to initiate motivated behavior},
abstract = {How does the brain translate information signaling potential rewards into motivation to get them? Motivation to obtain reward is thought to depend on the midbrain [particularly the ventral tegmental area (VTA)], the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), but it is not clear how the interactions among these regions relate to reward-motivated behavior. To study the influence of motivation on these reward-responsive regions and on their interactions, we used dynamic causal modeling to analyze functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from humans performing a simple task designed to isolate reward anticipation. The use of fMRI permitted the simultaneous measurement of multiple brain regions while human participants anticipated and prepared for opportunities to obtain reward, thus allowing characterization of how information about reward changes physiology underlying motivational drive. Furthermore, we modeled the impact of external reward cues on causal relationships within this network, thus elaborating a link between physiology, connectivity, and motivation. Specifically, our results indicated that dlPFC was the exclusive entry point of information about reward in this network, and that anticipated reward availability caused VTA activation only via its effect on the dlPFC. Anticipated reward thus increased dlPFC activation directly, whereas it influenced VTA and NAcc only indirectly, by enhancing intrinsically weak or inactive pathways from the dlPFC. Our findings of a directional prefrontal influence on dopaminergic regions during reward anticipation suggest a model in which the dlPFC integrates and transmits representations of reward to the mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine systems, thereby initiating motivated behavior.},

However, many biological oscillators also have a positive feedback loop, raising the question of what advantages the extra loop imparts. Through computational studies, we show that it is generally difficult to adjust a negative feedback oscillator's frequency without compromising its amplitude, whereas with positive-plus-negative feedback, one can achieve a widely tunable frequency and near-constant amplitude. This tunability makes the latter design suitable for biological rhythms like heartbeats and cell cycles that need to provide a constant output over a range of frequencies. Positive-plus-negative oscillators also appear to be more robust and easier to evolve, rationalizing why they are found in contexts where an adjustable frequency is unimportant.},

Across 4 studies, the authors found that participants scoring in the bottom quartile on tests of humor, grammar, and logic grossly overestimated their test performance and ability. Although their test scores put them in the 12th percentile, they estimated themselves to be in the 62nd. Several analyses linked this miscalibration to deficits in metacognitive skill, or the capacity to distinguish accuracy from error. Paradoxically, improving the skills of participants, and thus increasing their metacognitive competence, helped them recognize the limitations of their abilities.},

title = {Reading the mind's eye: decoding category information during mental imagery},
abstract = {Category information for visually presented objects can be read out from multi-voxel patterns of fMRI activity in ventral-temporal cortex. What is the nature and reliability of these patterns in the absence of any bottom-up visual input, for example, during visual imagery? Here, we first ask how well category information can be decoded for imagined objects and then compare the representations evoked during imagery and actual viewing. In an fMRI study, four object categories (food, tools, faces, buildings) were either visually presented to subjects, or imagined by them. Using pattern classification techniques, we could reliably decode category information (including for non-special categories, i.e., food and tools) from ventral-temporal cortex in both conditions, but only during actual viewing from retinotopic areas. Interestingly, in temporal cortex when the classifier was trained on the viewed condition and tested on the imagery condition, or vice versa, classification performance was comparable to within the imagery condition. The above results held even when we did not use information in the specialized category-selective areas. Thus, the patterns of representation during imagery and actual viewing are in fact surprisingly similar to each other. Consistent with this observation, the maps of "diagnostic voxels" (i.e., the classifier weights) for the perception and imagery classifiers were more similar in ventral-temporal cortex than in retinotopic cortex. These results suggest that in the absence of any bottom-up input, cortical back projections can selectively re-activate specific patterns of neural activity.},

The subjects were told to perform the movement after a tone. We have exploited a novel use of event-related fMRI. By systematically varying the interval between the visual and acoustic stimuli, it has been possible to estimate the significance of the evoked haemodynamic response (EHR) to each of the stimuli, despite their temporal proximity in relation to the time constant of the EHR. Furthermore, by varying the phase between events and image acquisition, we have been able to achieve high temporal resolution while scanning the whole brain. We dissociated sensory and motor components of the sensorimotor transformations elicited by the task, and assessed sustained activity during the instructed delays. In calcarine and occipitotemporal cortex, the responses were exclusively associated with the visual instruction cues. In temporal auditory cortex and in primary motor cortex, they were exclusively associated with the auditory trigger stimulus. In ventral prefrontal cortex there were movement-related responses preceded by preparatory activity and by signal-related activity. Finally, responses associated with the instruction cue and with sustained activity during the delay period were observed in the dorsal premotor cortex and in the dorsal posterior parietal cortex. Where the association between a visual cue and the appropriate movement is arbitrary, the underlying visuomotor transformations are not achieved exclusively through frontoparietal interactions. Rather, these processes seem to rely on the ventral visual stream, the ventral prefrontal cortex and the anterior part of the dorsal premotor cortex.},

abstract = {Phasic activation of dopaminergic neurons is associated with reward-predicting cues and supports learning during behavioral adaptation. While noncontingent activation of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental are (VTA) is sufficient for passive behavioral conditioning, it remains unknown whether the phasic dopaminergic signal is truly reinforcing. In this study, we first targeted the expression of channelrhodopsin-2 to dopaminergic neurons of the VTA and optimized optogenetically evoked dopamine transients. Second, we showed that phasic activation of dopaminergic neurons in freely moving mice causally enhances positive reinforcing actions in a food-seeking operant task. Interestingly, such effect was not found in the absence of food reward. We further found that phasic activation of dopaminergic neurons is sufficient to reactivate previously extinguished food-seeking behavior in the absence of external cues. This was also confirmed using a single-session reversal paradigm. Collectively, these data suggest that activation of dopaminergic neurons facilitates the development of positive reinforcement during reward-seeking and behavioral flexibility.},

title = {Contextual Novelty Changes Reward Representations in the Striatum},
abstract = {Reward representation in ventral striatum is boosted by perceptual novelty, although the mechanism of this effect remains elusive. Animal studies indicate a functional loop (Lisman and Grace, 2005) that includes hippocampus, ventral striatum, and midbrain as being important in regulating salience attribution within the context of novel stimuli. According to this model, reward responses in ventral striatum or midbrain should be enhanced in the context of novelty even if reward and novelty constitute unrelated, independent events. Using fMRI, we show that trials with reward-predictive cues and subsequent outcomes elicit higher responses in the striatum if preceded by an unrelated novel picture, indicating that reward representation is enhanced in the context of novelty. Notably, this effect was observed solely when reward occurrence, and hence reward-related salience, was low. These findings support a view that contextual novelty enhances neural responses underlying reward representation in the striatum and concur with the effects of novelty processing as predicted by the model of Lisman and Grace (2005).},

abstract = {Multiple signals for reward-hedonic impact, motivation, and learned associative prediction-are funneled through brain mesocorticolimbic circuits involving the nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum. Here, we show how the hedonic "liking" and motivation "wanting" signals for a sweet reward are distinctly modulated and tracked in this circuit separately from signals for Pavlovian predictions (learning). Animals first learned to associate a fixed sequence of Pavlovian cues with sucrose reward. Subsequent intraaccumbens microinjections of an opioid-stimulating drug increased the hedonic liking impact of sucrose in behavior and firing signals of ventral pallidum neurons, and likewise, they increased incentive salience signals in firing to the reward-proximal incentive cue (but did not alter firing signals to the learned prediction value of a reward-distal cue). Microinjection of a dopamine-stimulating drug instead enhanced only the motivation component but did not alter hedonic impact or learned prediction signals. Different dedicated neuronal subpopulations in the ventral pallidum tracked signal enhancements for hedonic impact vs. incentive salience, and a faster firing pattern also distinguished incentive signals from slower hedonic signals, even for a third overlapping population. These results reveal separate neural representations of wanting, liking, and prediction components of the same reward within the nucleus accumbens to ventral pallidum segment of mesocorticolimbic circuitry.},

abstract = {Motor skill learning requires the involvement and integration of several cortical and subcortical regions. In this study, we focus on how the functional connectivity of cortical networks changes with the acquisition of a novel motor skill. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we measured the localized blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal in cortical regions while subjects performed a bimanual serial reaction time task under 2 conditions: 1) explicitly learning a novel sequence (NOVEL) and 2) playing a previously learned sequence (LEARNED). To investigate stages of learning, each condition was further divided into nonoverlapping early and late conditions. Functional connectivity was measured using a task-specific low-frequency coherence analysis of the data. We show that within the cortical motor network, the sensorimotor cortex, premotor cortex, and supplementary motor area have significantly greater inter- and intrahemispheric coupling during the early NOVEL condition compared with the late NOVEL condition. Additionally, we observed greater connectivity between frontal regions and cortical motor regions in the early versus late NOVEL contrast. No changes in functional connectivity were observed in the LEARNED condition. These results demonstrate that the functional connectivity of the cortical motor network is modulated with practice and suggest that early skill learning is mediated by enhanced interregional coupling.},

abstract = {Current models of the basal ganglia and dopamine neurons emphasize their role in reinforcement learning. However, the role of dopamine neurons in decision making is still unclear. We recorded from dopamine neurons in monkeys engaged in two types of trial: reference trials in an instructed-choice task and decision trials in a two-armed bandit decision task. We show that the activity of dopamine neurons in the decision setting is modulated according to the value of the upcoming action. Moreover, analysis of the probability matching strategy in the decision trials revealed that the dopamine population activity and not the reward during reference trials determines choice behavior. Because dopamine neurons do not have spatial or motor properties, we conclude that immediate decisions are likely to be generated elsewhere and conveyed to the dopamine neurons, which play a role in shaping long-term decision policy through dynamic modulation of the efficacy of basal ganglia synapses.},

title = {Cerebral changes during performance of overlearned arbitrary visuomotor associations},
abstract = {The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is known to be involved in the control of automatic movements that are spatially guided, such as grasping an apple. We considered whether the PPC might also contribute to the performance of visuomotor associations in which stimuli and responses are linked arbitrarily, such as producing a certain sound for a typographical character when reading aloud or pressing pedals according to the color of a traffic light when driving a motor vehicle. The PPC does not appear to be necessary for learning new arbitrary visuomotor associations, but with extensive training, the PPC can encode nonspatial sensory features of task-relevant cues. Accordingly, we have tested whether the contributions of the PPC might become apparent once arbitrary sensorimotor mappings are overlearned. We have used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure cerebral activity while subjects were learning novel arbitrary visuomotor associations, overlearning known mappings, or attempting to learn frequently changing novel mappings. To capture the dynamic features of cerebral activity related to the learning process, we have compared time-varying modulations of activity between conditions rather than average (steady-state) responses. Frontal, striatal, and intraparietal regions showed decreasing or stable activity when subjects learned or attempted to learn novel associations, respectively. Importantly, the same frontal, striatal, and intraparietal regions showed time-dependent increases in activity over time as the mappings become overlearned, i.e., despite time-invariant behavioral responses. The automaticity of these mappings predicted the degree of intraparietal changes, indicating that the contribution of the PPC might be related to a particular stage of the overlearning process. We suggest that, as the visuomotor mappings become robust to interference, the PPC may convey relevant sensory information toward the motor cortex. More generally, our findings illustrate how rich cerebral dynamics can underlie stable behavior.},

abstract = {As a major output station of the basal ganglia, the globus pallidus internal segment (GPi) projects to the thalamus and brainstem nuclei thereby control- ling motor behavior. A less well known fact is that the GPi also projects to the lateral habenula (LHb) which is often associated with the limbic system. Using the monkey performing a saccade task with positionally biased reward outcomes, we found that antidromically identified LHb-projecting neurons were distributed mainly in the dorsal and ventral bor- ders of the GPi and that their activity was strongly modulated by expected reward outcomes. A majority of them were excited by the no-reward-predicting target and inhibited by the reward-predicting target. These reward-dependent modulations were similar to those in LHb neurons but started earlier than those in LHb neurons. These results suggest that GPi may initiate reward-related signals through its effects on the LHb, which then influences the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems.},

title = {Decoding near-threshold perception of fear from distributed single-trial brain activation},
abstract = {Instead of contrasting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals associated with 2 conditions, as customarily done in neuroimaging, we reversed the direction of analysis and probed whether brain signals could be used to "predict" perceptual states. We probed the neural correlates of perceptual decisions by "decoding" brain states during near-threshold fear detection. Decoding was attempted by using support vector machines and other related techniques. Although previous decoding studies have employed relatively "blocked" data, our objective was to probe how the "moment-to-moment" fluctuation in fMRI signals across a population of voxels reflected the participant's perceptual decision. Accuracy increased from when 1 region was considered (approximately 64%) to when 10 regions were used (approximately 78%). When the best classifications per subject were averaged, accuracy levels ranged between 74% and 86% correct. An information theoretic analysis revealed that the information carried by pairs of regions reliably exceeded the sum of the information carried by individual regions, suggesting that information was combined "synergistically" across regions. Our results indicate that the representation of behavioral choice is "distributed" across several brain regions. Such distributed encoding may help prepare the organism to appropriately handle emotional stimuli and regulate the associated emotional response upon the conscious decision that a fearful face is present. In addition, the results show that challenging brain states can be decoded with high accuracy even when "single-trial" data are employed and suggest that multivariate analysis strategies have considerable potential in helping to elucidate the neural correlates of visual awareness and the encoding of perceptual decisions.},

abstract = {In this study we demonstrate that, even in blocked design fMRI, an event-related analysis may provide a more accurate model of the hemodynamic responses than an epoch-related analysis. This is because the temporal shape of the predicted response differs between the event-related and the epoch model, with the former reaching its peak sooner and returning to baseline later than the latter. We present data from a blocked design fMRI study of single word reading alternated with rest. Conventionally, such a design would be analyzed using an epoch analysis with boxcar regressors. However, here we used a combined model in which trials were modeled as both single events and epochs. This allowed us to estimate the variance in the BOLD signal that was explained by either the event-related or the epoch regressors having discounted the effect of the other. We found that, in a number of language regions, the event-related model explained changes in activity that were not accounted for by the epoch model. In addition, we show that the advantage of the event-related over epoch model was engendered by its early onset rather than its late offset, relative to the epoch model.},

abstract = {The mesolimbic dopamine system is centrally involved in reward and goal-directed behavior, and it has been implicated in multiple psychiatric disorders. Understanding the mechanism by which dopamine participates in these activities requires comprehension of the dynamics of dopamine release. Here we report dissociable regulation of dopamine neuron discharge by two separate afferent systems in rats; inhibition of pallidal afferents selectively increased the population activity of dopamine neurons, whereas activation of pedunculopontine inputs increased burst firing. Only the increase in population activity increased ventral striatal dopamine efflux. After blockade of dopamine reuptake, however, enhanced bursting increased dopamine efflux three times more than did enhanced population activity. These results provide insight into multiple regulatory systems that modulate dopamine system function: burst firing induces massive synaptic dopamine release, which is rapidly removed by reuptake before escaping the synaptic cleft, whereas increased population activity modulates tonic extrasynaptic dopamine levels that are less influenced by reuptake.},

title = {Movement preparation and motor intention},
abstract = {This paper addresses the functional anatomy of movement representation. We have used associative visuomotor tasks with instructed delays to elicit motor preparatory activity. We regard such activity, when independent from transient stimulus-locked responses, as a likely candidate for the neural basis of movement representation (M. Jeannerod, The Cognitive Neuroscience of Action. Blackwell, Oxford, 1997). In a first event-related fMRI experiment, we found that preparing to move according to arbitrary visuomotor associations relies not only on parietofrontal circuitry, but also on portions of the posterior superior temporal sulcus. In a separate behavioral experiment, we discarded the hypothesis that such activities were confounded by working memory processes. In a second imaging experiment, we have further defined the relative contributions of these parietal, premotor, and temporal areas to the preparatory process and their involvement in motor representations. We conclude that posterior parietal cortex is interested in evaluating the potential motor significance of sensory stimuli, irrespectively of the likelihood of providing a response ("motor intention"). Conversely, preparatory activity in frontal premotor regions appears to be a function of the probability of a subsequent movement. Finally, on the basis of the present and published data, we suggest that posterior temporal cortex might be involved in the extraction of contextual and intentional cues during goal-oriented behavior.},

title = {Dynamical model of salience gated working memory, action selection and reinforcement based on basal ganglia and dopamine feedback},
abstract = {A simple working memory model based on recurrent network activation is proposed and its application to selection and reinforcement of an action is demonstrated as a solution to the temporal credit assignment problem. Reactivation of recent salient cue states is generated and maintained as a type of salience gated recurrently active working memory, while lower salience distractors are ignored. Cue reactivation during the action selection period allows the cue to select an action while its reactivation at the reward period allows the reinforcement of the action selected by the reactivated state, which is necessarily the action which led to the reward being found. A down-gating of the external input during the reactivation and maintenance prevents interference. A double winner-take-all system which selects only one cue and only one action allows the targeting of the cue-action allocation to be modified. This targeting works both to reinforce a correct cue-action allocation and to punish the allocation when cue-action allocations change. Here we suggest a firing rate neural network implementation of this system based on the basal ganglia anatomy with input from a cortical association layer where reactivations are generated by signals from the thalamus. Striatum medium spiny neurons represent actions. Auto-catalytic feedback from a dopamine reward signal modulates three-way Hebbian long term potentiation and depression at the cortical-striatal synapses which represent the cue-action associations. The model is illustrated by the numerical simulations of a simple example--that of associating a cue signal to a correct action to obtain reward after a delay period, typical of primate cue reward tasks. Through learning, the model shows a transition from an exploratory phase where actions are generated randomly, to a stable directed phase where the animal always chooses the correct action for each experienced state. When cue-action allocations change, we show that this is noticed by the model, the incorrect cue-action allocations are punished and the correct ones discovered.},

abstract = {A simple negative feedback loop of interacting genes or proteins has the potential to generate sustained oscillations. However, many biological oscillators also have a positive feedback loop, raising the question of what advantages the extra loop imparts. Through computational studies, we show that it is generally difficult to adjust a negative feedback oscillator's frequency without compromising its amplitude, whereas with positive-plus-negative feedback, one can achieve a widely tunable frequency and near-constant amplitude. This tunability makes the latter design suitable for biological rhythms like heartbeats and cell cycles that need to provide a constant output over a range of frequencies. Positive-plus-negative oscillators also appear to be more robust and easier to evolve, rationalizing why they are found in contexts where an adjustable frequency is unimportant.},

Differentially phased neuronal clocks are topographically arranged across the SCN.

abstract = {The substantial health risk posed by obesity and compulsive drug use has compelled a serious research effort to identify the neurobiological substrates that underlie the development these pathological conditions. Despite substantial progress, an understanding of the neurochemical systems that mediate the motivational aspects of drug-seeking and craving remains incomplete. Important work from the laboratory of Bart Hoebel has provided key information on neurochemical systems that interact with dopamine (DA) as potentially important components in both the development of addiction and the expression of compulsive behaviors such as binge eating. One such modulatory system appears to be cholinergic pathways that interact with DA systems at all levels of the reward circuit. Cholinergic cells in the pons project to DA-rich cell body regions in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantial nigra (SN) where they modulate the activity of dopaminergic neurons and reward processing. The DA terminal region of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) contains a small but particularly important group of cholinergic interneurons, which have extensive dendritic arbors that make synapses with a vast majority of NAc neurons and afferents. Together with acetylcholine (ACh) input onto DA cell bodies, cholinergic systems could serve a vital role in gating information flow concerning the motivational value of stimuli through the mesolimbic system. In this report we highlight evidence that CNS cholinergic systems play a pivotal role in behaviors that are motivated by both natural and drug rewards. We argue that the search for underlying neurochemical substrates of compulsive behaviors, as well as attempts to identify potential pharmacotherapeutic targets to combat them, must include a consideration of central cholinergic systems.},

title = {When does stress help or harm? The effects of stress controllability and subjective stress response on stroop performance},
abstract = {The ability to engage in goal-directed behavior despite exposure to stress is critical to resilience. Questions of how stress can impair or improve behavioral functioning are important in diverse settings, from athletic competitions to academic testing. Previous research suggests that controllability is a key factor in the impact of stress on behavior: learning how to control stressors buffers people from the negative effects of stress on subsequent cognitively demanding tasks. In addition, research suggests that the impact of stress on cognitive functioning depends on an individual's response to stressors: moderate responses to stress can lead to improved performance while extreme (high or low) responses can lead to impaired performance. The present studies tested the hypothesis that (1) learning to behaviorally control stressors leads to improved performance on a test of general executive functioning, the color-word Stroop, and that (2) this improvement emerges specifically for people who report moderate (subjective) responses to stress. Experiment 1: Stroop performance, measured before and after a stress manipulation, was compared across groups of undergraduate participants (n = 109). People who learned to control a noise stressor and received accurate performance feedback demonstrated reduced Stroop interference compared with people exposed to uncontrollable noise stress and feedback indicating an exaggerated rate of failure. In the group who learned behavioral control, those who reported moderate levels of stress showed the greatest reduction in Stroop interference. In contrast, in the group exposed to uncontrollable events, self-reported stress failed to predict performance. Experiment 2: In a second sample (n = 90), we specifically investigated the role of controllability by keeping the rate of failure feedback constant across groups. In the group who learned behavioral control, those who reported moderate levels of stress showed the greatest Stroop improvement. Once again, this pattern was not demonstrated in the group exposed to uncontrollable events. These results suggest that stress controllability and subjective response interact to affect high-level cognitive abilities. Specifically, exposure to moderate, controllable stress benefits performance, but exposure to uncontrollable stress or having a more extreme response to stress tends to harm performance. These findings may provide insights on how to leverage the beneficial effects of stress in a range of settings.},

title = {Anticipatory affect: neural correlates and consequences for choice},
abstract = {'Anticipatory affect' refers to emotional states that people experience while anticipating significant outcomes. Historically, technical limitations have made it difficult to determine whether anticipatory affect influences subsequent choice. Recent advances in the spatio-temporal resolution of functional magnetic resonance imaging, however, now allow researchers to visualize changes in neural activity seconds before choice occurs. We review evidence that activation in specific brain circuits changes during anticipation of monetary incentives, that this activation correlates with affective experience and that activity in these circuits may influence subsequent choice. Specifically, an activation likelihood estimate meta-analysis of cued response studies indicates that nucleus accumbens (NAcc) activation increases during gain anticipation relative to loss anticipation, while anterior insula activation increases during both loss and gain anticipation. Additionally, anticipatory NAcc activation correlates with self-reported positive arousal, whereas anterior insula activation correlates with both self-reported negative and positive arousal. Finally, NAcc activation precedes the purchase of desirable products and choice of high-risk gambles, whereas anterior insula activation precedes the rejection of overpriced products and choice of low-risk gambles. Together, these findings support a neurally plausible framework for understanding how anticipatory affect can influence choice.},

title = {Multi-objective optimal experimental designs for event-related fMRI studies},
abstract = {In this article, we propose an efficient approach to find optimal experimental designs for event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (ER-fMRI). We consider multiple objectives, including estimating the hemodynamic response function (HRF), detecting activation, circumventing psychological confounds and fulfilling customized requirements. Taking into account these goals, we formulate a family of multi-objective design criteria and develop a genetic-algorithm-based technique to search for optimal designs. Our proposed technique incorporates existing knowledge about the performance of fMRI designs, and its usefulness is shown through simulations. Although our approach also works for other linear combinations of parameters, we primarily focus on the case when the interest lies either in the individual stimulus effects or in pairwise contrasts between stimulus types. Under either of these popular cases, our algorithm outperforms the previous approaches. We also find designs yielding higher estimation efficiencies than m-sequences. When the underlying model is with white noise and a constant nuisance parameter, the stimulus frequencies of the designs we obtained are in good agreement with the optimal stimulus frequencies derived by Liu and Frank, 2004, NeuroImage 21: 387-400. In addition, our approach is built upon a rigorous model formulation.},

title = {Shaping of motor responses by incentive values through the basal ganglia},
abstract = {The striatum is a key neural interface for cognitive and motor information processing in which associations between reward value and visual stimulus can be used to modify motor commands. It can guide action-selection processes that occur farther downstream in the basal ganglia (BG) circuit, by encoding the reward value of an action. Here, we report on the study of simultaneously recorded neurons in the dorsal striatum (input stage of the BG) and the internal pallidum (output stage of the BG) in two monkeys performing a center-out motor task in which the visual targets were associated with different reward probabilities. We show that the tuning curves of motor-related neurons in both structures are modulated by the value of the action before movement initiation and during its execution. The representations of values associated with different actions change dynamically during the task in the internal globus pallidus, with a significant increase in the number of encoding neurons for the chosen target at the onset of movement. This report sheds additional light on the functional differences between the input and output structures of the BG and supports the assertion that the dorsal basal ganglia are involved in movement-related decision-making processes based on incentive values.},

title = {Addiction and the brain antireward system},
abstract = {A neurobiological model of the brain emotional systems has been proposed to explain the persistent changes in motivation that are associated with vulnerability to relapse in addiction, and this model may generalize to other psychopathology associated with dysregulated motivational systems. In this framework, addiction is conceptualized as a cycle of decreased function of brain reward systems and recruitment of antireward systems that progressively worsen, resulting in the compulsive use of drugs. Counteradaptive processes, such as opponent process, that are part of the normal homeostatic limitation of reward function fail to return within the normal homeostatic range and are hypothesized to repeatedly drive the allostatic state. Excessive drug taking thus results in not only the short-term amelioration of the reward deficit but also suppression of the antireward system. However, in the long term, there is worsening of the underlying neurochemical dysregulations that ultimately form an allostatic state (decreased dopamine and opioid peptide function, increased corticotropin-releasing factor activity). This allostatic state is hypothesized to be reflected in a chronic deviation of reward set point that is fueled not only by dysregulation of reward circuits per se but also by recruitment of brain and hormonal stress responses. Vulnerability to addiction may involve genetic comorbidity and developmental factors at the molecular, cellular, or neurocircuitry levels that sensitize the brain antireward systems.},

title = {Statistical limitations in functional neuroimaging. I. Non-inferential methods and statistical models},
abstract = {Functional neuroimaging (FNI) provides experimental access to the intact living brain making it possible to study higher cognitive functions in humans. In this review and in a companion paper in this issue, we discuss some common methods used to analyse FNI data. The emphasis in both papers is on assumptions and limitations of the methods reviewed. There are several methods available to analyse FNI data indicating that none is optimal for all purposes. In order to make optimal use of the methods available it is important to know the limits of applicability. For the interpretation of FNI results it is also important to take into account the assumptions, approximations and inherent limitations of the methods used. This paper gives a brief overview over some non-inferential descriptive methods and common statistical models used in FNI. Issues relating to the complex problem of model selection are discussed. In general, proper model selection is a necessary prerequisite for the validity of the subsequent statistical inference. The non-inferential section describes methods that, combined with inspection of parameter estimates and other simple measures, can aid in the process of model selection and verification of assumptions. The section on statistical models covers approaches to global normalization and some aspects of univariate, multivariate, and Bayesian models. Finally, approaches to functional connectivity and effective connectivity are discussed. In the companion paper we review issues related to signal detection and statistical inference.},

abstract = {Although much is known about the neural substrates of reward, the question of whether expectation of different types of reinforcers engage distinct or overlapping brain circuitry has not been addressed definitively. In the present study, human subjects, while being scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging, performed a simple reward-based action selection task to obtain different magnitudes of either monetary outcomes (winning or losing money) or juice outcomes (pleasant apple juice or an unpleasant salt flavor). At the group level, we found partially overlapping value-related activity within ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) during anticipation of juice and money reward outcomes. Analogous results were found in the right anterior insula, except that this region showed negative correlations as a function of increasing expected reward. These results indicate that vmPFC and anterior insula contain overlapping representations of anticipatory value, consistent with the existence of a common currency for the value of expected outcomes in these regions.},

Only 11 of these neurons showed exclusively this type of activity. The beginnings and ends of tonic responses were generally associated with key moments in the behavior, corresponding to the triggering and completion of immediate aims during the performance of the behavioral program as a whole.

abstract = {The authors test a neurocomputational model of dopamine function in cognition by administering to healthy participants low doses of D-sub-2 agents cabergoline and haloperidol. The model suggests that DA dynamically modulates the balance of Go and No-Go basal ganglia pathways during cognitive learning and performance. Cabergoline impaired, while haloperidol enhanced, Go learning from positive reinforcement, consistent with presynaptic drug effects. Cabergoline also caused an overall bias toward Go responding, consistent with postsynaptic action. These same effects extended to working memory and attentional domains, supporting the idea that the basal ganglia/dopamine system modulates the updating of prefrontal representations. Drug effects interacted with baseline working memory span in all tasks. Taken together, the results support a unified account of the role of dopamine in modulating cognitive processes that depend on the basal ganglia. ((c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved).},

title = {Role of primate basal ganglia and frontal cortex in the internal generation of movements. II. Movement-related activity in the anterior striatum},
abstract = {In order to more comprehensively assess the role of the basal ganglia in the internal generation of movements, we studied the activity of neurons in the head of the caudate and in the rostral putamen in relation to the execution of movements. Monkeys performed self-initiated and stimulus-triggered arm reaching movements in separate blocks of trials. With stimulus-triggered movements, 217 striatal neurons increased their activity after the trigger stimulus (127 in caudate, 90 in putamen). Of these, 68 neurons showed time-locked responses to the trigger stimulus, with a median latency of 60 ms, that were independent of visual or auditory stimulus modalities. Three quarters of responses were conditional on a movement being performed. These responses may participate in neuronal processes through which the reception of a stimulus is translated into the execution of a behavioral reaction. Further, 44 neurons increased their activity before the earliest muscle activity without being clearly time-locked to the stimulus (148-324 ms before movement onset), 55 neurons were activated later before the movement, and 50 neurons were activated after movement onset. With self-initiated movements, 106 striatal neurons showed movement-related activity beginning up to 460 ms before movement onset (52 in caudate, 54 in putamen). Comparisons between the two types of movement were made on 53 neurons with premovement activity beginning more than 500 ms before self-initiated movements. Only one fifth of them also showed movement-related activity with stimulus-triggered movements, including trigger responses. Comparisons among 39 neurons with movement-related activity during self-initiated arm movements showed that about half of them also showed movement-related activity with stimulus-triggered movements. These data demonstrate a considerably segregated population of striatal neurons engaged in the internal generation of movements, whereas processes underlying the execution of movements appear to involve overlapping neuronal populations.},

title = {Dopamine responses comply with basic assumptions of formal learning theory},
abstract = {According to contemporary learning theories, the discrepancy, or error, between the actual and predicted reward determines whether learning occurs when a stimulus is paired with a reward. The role of prediction errors is directly demonstrated by the observation that learning is blocked when the stimulus is paired with a fully predicted reward. By using this blocking procedure, we show that the responses of dopamine neurons to conditioned stimuli was governed differentially by the occurrence of reward prediction errors rather than stimulus-reward associations alone, as was the learning of behavioural reactions. Both behavioural and neuronal learning occurred predominantly when dopamine neurons registered a reward prediction error at the time of the reward. Our data indicate that the use of analytical tests derived from formal behavioural learning theory provides a powerful approach for studying the role of single neurons in learning.},

title = {Deconvolution of impulse response in event-related BOLD fMRI},
abstract = {The temporal characteristics of the BOLD response in sensorimotor and auditory cortices were measured in subjects performing finger tapping while listening to metronome pacing tones. A repeated trial paradigm was used with stimulus durations of 167 ms to 16 s and intertrial times of 30 s. Both cortical systems were found to be nonlinear in that the response to a long stimulus could not be predicted by convolving the 1-s response with a rectangular function. In the short-time regime, the amplitude of the response varied only slowly with stimulus duration. It was found that this character was predicted with a modification to Buxton's balloon model. Wiener deconvolution was used to deblur the response to concatenated short episodes of finger tapping at different temporal separations and at rates from 1 to 4 Hz. While the measured response curves were distorted by overlap between the individual episodes, the deconvolved response at each rate was found to agree well with separate scans at each of the individual rates. Thus, although the impulse response cannot predict the response to fully overlapping stimuli, linear deconvolution is effective when the stimuli are separated by at least 4 s. The deconvolution filter must be measured for each subject using a short-stimulus paradigm. It is concluded that deconvolution may be effective in diminishing the hemodynamically imposed temporal blurring and may have potential applications in quantitating responses in eventrelated fMRI.},

abstract = {People are alarmingly susceptible to manipulations that change both their expectations and experience of the value of goods. Recent studies in behavioral economics suggest such variability reflects more than mere caprice. People commonly judge options and prices in relative terms, rather than absolutely, and display strong sensitivity to exemplar and price anchors. We propose that these findings elucidate important principles about reward processing in the brain. In particular, relative valuation may be a natural consequence of adaptive coding of neuronal firing to optimise sensitivity across large ranges of value. Furthermore, the initial apparent arbitrariness of value may reflect the brains' attempts to optimally integrate diverse sources of value-relevant information in the face of perceived uncertainty. Recent findings in neuroscience support both accounts, and implicate regions in the orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex in the construction of value.},

title = {Inactivation of the lateral but not medial dorsal striatum eliminates the excitatory impact of Pavlovian stimuli on instrumental responding},
abstract = {Conditioned stimuli are important guides for behavioral actions. This experiment determined the role of the dorsal striatum in conditioned-stimulus modulation of instrumental responding using the pavlovian-instrumental transfer (PIT) paradigm. Rats received pavlovian training wherein two different auditory stimuli predicted the delivery of two food rewards. Next, rats were trained to perform two instrumental actions earning the same two rewards. Finally, the impact of pavlovian stimuli on instrumental performance was assessed in extinction: the stimuli were periodically presented while rats were free to perform the lever-press response. Before testing, medial or lateral dorsal striatum was infused with saline or baclofen/muscimol, to temporarily inactivate the region. Under saline, outcome-selective PIT was observed: presentation of a stimulus paired with the same outcome as the instrumental action elevated responding, whereas presentation of a stimulus paired with a different outcome did not. Inactivation of the dorsolateral striatum dramatically reduced this effect. Inactivation of the dorsomedial striatum left intact the ability of reward-related stimuli to invigorate responding; however, the selectivity of the stimulus effect was lost (i.e., both stimuli excited responding). These results indicate that subregions of the dorsal striatum play distinct roles in stimulus modulation of instrumental performance with the lateral region being vital for reward-related stimuli to excite responding and the medial region being involved in the integration of stimulus-reward associations with specific response-outcome associations to produce selective responding. These findings identify new roles for the dorsal striatum in mediating the incentive effects of reward-predictive stimuli on behavioral actions made to obtain reward.},

abstract = {Midbrain dopamine neurons are activated when reward is greater than predicted, and this error signal could teach target neurons both the value of reward and when it will occur. We used the dopamine error signal to measure how the expectation of reward was distributed over time. Animals were trained with fixed-duration intervals of 1-16 s between conditioned stimulus onset and reward. In contrast to the weak responses that have been observed after short intervals (1-2 s), activations to reward increased steeply and linearly with the logarithm of the interval. Results with varied stimulus-reward intervals suggest that the neural expectation was substantial after just half an interval had elapsed. Thus, the neural expectation of reward in these experiments was not highly precise and the precision declined sharply with interval duration. The neural precision of expectation appeared to be at least qualitatively similar to the precision of anticipatory licking behavior.},

abstract = {The serotonin (5-HT) system is implicated in incentive motivational processes. The present study utilized the acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) procedure to investigate the effect of temporarily lowering 5-HT synthesis on motivation in healthy volunteers, stratifying the results by allelic variation at the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR). ATD resulted in a robust reduction in plasma tryptophan concentration. Consistent with a previous study, ATD attenuated motivationally speeded action on the Cued-Reinforcement Reaction Time task. The present investigation revealed that this effect was restricted to volunteers of the ss genotype, whereas ll volunteers exhibited intact motivationally speeded action following ATD (treatment x reinforcement probability x genotype interaction: F1,26=5.8, p=0.024). Furthermore, tryptophan availability to the brain was correlated positively with motivationally speeded action following ATD in the ss genotype group (rho13=0.71, p=0.006), whereas this correlation was negative in the ll genotype group (rho14=-0.60, p=0.023). This is the first study to suggest that allelic variation at the 5-HTTLPR mediates motivational responses to ATD in healthy volunteers. These data indicate that the s allele at the 5-HTTLPR may confer risk for depression via its effect on incentive motivational processing, and highlight the importance of genetic variation in determining individual responses to pharmacological treatments.},

abstract = {Estimates of hemodynamic response functions (HRF) are often integral parts of event-related fMRI analyses. Although HRFs vary across individuals and brain regions, few studies have investigated how variations affect the results of statistical analyses using the general linear model (GLM). In this study, we empirically estimated HRFs from primary motor and visual cortices and frontal and supplementary eye fields (SEF) in 20 subjects. We observed more variability across subjects than regions and correlated variation of time-to-peak values across several pairs of regions. Simulations examined the effects of observed variability on statistical results and ways different experimental designs and statistical models can limit these effects. Widely spaced and rapid event-related experimental designs with two sampling rates were tested. Statistical models compared an empirically derived HRF to a canonical HRF and included the first derivative of the HRF in the GLM. Small differences between the estimated and true HRFs did not cause false negatives, but larger differences within an observed range of variation, such as a 2.5-s time-to-onset misestimate, led to false negatives. Although small errors minimally affected detection of activity, time-to-onset misestimates as small as 1 s influenced model parameter estimation and therefore random effects analyses across subjects. Experiment and analysis design methods such as decreasing the sampling rate or including the HRF's temporal derivative in the GLM improved results, but did not eliminate errors caused by HRF misestimates. These results highlight the benefits of determining the best possible HRF estimate and potential negative consequences of assuming HRF consistency across subjects or brain regions.},

title = {Parallel cortico-basal ganglia mechanisms for acquisition and execution of visuomotor sequences - a computational approach},
abstract = {Experimental studies have suggested that many brain areas, including the basal ganglia (BG), contribute to procedural learning. Focusing on the basal ganglia-thalamocortical (BG-TC) system, we propose a computational model to explain how different brain areas work together in procedural learning. The BG-TC system is composed of multiple separate loop circuits. According to our model, two separate BG-TC loops learn a visuomotor sequence concurrently but using different coordinates, one visual, and the other motor. The visual loop includes the dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPF) cortex and the anterior part of the BG, while the motor loop includes the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the posterior BG. The concurrent learning in these loops is based on reinforcement signals carried by dopaminergic (DA) neurons that project divergently to the anterior ("visual") and posterior ("motor") parts of the striatum. It is expected, however, that the visual loop learns a sequence faster than the motor loop due to their different coordinates. The difference in learning speed may lead to inconsistent outputs from the visual and motor loops, and this problem is solved by a mechanism called a "coordinator," which adjusts the contribution of the visual and motor loops to a final motor output. The coordinator is assumed to be in the presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA). We hypothesize that the visual and motor loops, with the help of the coordinator, achieve both the quick acquisition of novel sequences and the robust execution of well-learned sequences. A computational model based on the hypothesis is examined in a series of computer simulations, referring to the results of the 2 x 5 task experiments that have been used on both monkeys and humans. We found that the dual mechanism with the coordinator was superior to the single (visual or motor) mechanism. The model replicated the following essential features of the experimental results: (1) the time course of learning, (2) the effect of opposite hand use, (3) the effect of sequence reversal, and (4) the effects of localized brain inactivations. Our model may account for a common feature of procedural learning: A spatial sequence of discrete actions (subserved by the visual loop) is gradually replaced by a robust motor skill (subserved by the motor loop).},

abstract = {Considerable evidence suggests that, in instrumental conditioning, rats learn the relationship between actions and their specific consequences or outcomes. The present study examined the role of the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) in this type of learning after excitotoxic lesions and reversible, muscimol-induced inactivation. In three experiments, rats were first trained to press two levers for distinct outcomes, and then tested after training using a variety of behavioural assays that have been established to detect action-outcome learning. In Experiment 1, pre-training lesions of the posterior DMS abolished the sensitivity of rats' instrumental performance to both outcome devaluation and contingency degradation when tested in extinction, whereas lesions of the anterior DMS had no effect. In Experiment 2, both pre-training and post-training lesions of the posterior DMS were equally effective in reducing the sensitivity of performance both to devaluation and degradation treatments. In Experiment 3, the infusion of muscimol into the posterior DMS selectively abolished sensitivity of performance to devaluation and contingency degradation without impairing the ability of rats to discriminate either the instrumental actions performed or the identity of the earned outcomes. Taken together, these results suggest that the posterior region of the DMS is a crucial neural substrate for the acquisition and expression of action-outcome associations in instrumental conditioning.},

These include goal values that measure the predicted reward that results from the outcome generated by each of the actions under consideration, decision values that measure the net value of taking the different actions, and prediction errors that measure deviations from individuals' previous reward expectations. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging and a novel decision-making paradigm to dissociate the neural basis of these three computations. Our results show that they are supported by different neural substrates: goal values are correlated with activity in the medial orbitofrontal cortex, decision values are correlated with activity in the central orbitofrontal cortex, and prediction errors are correlated with activity in the ventral striatum.},

abstract = {Current theories hypothesize that dopamine neuronal firing encodes reward prediction errors. Although studies in nonhuman species provide direct support for this theory, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in humans have focused on brain areas targeted by dopamine neurons [ventral striatum (VStr)] rather than on brainstem dopaminergic nuclei [ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra]. We used fMRI tailored to directly image the brainstem. When primary rewards were used in an experiment, the VTA blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response reflected a positive reward prediction error, whereas the VStr encoded positive and negative reward prediction errors. When monetary gains and losses were used, VTA BOLD responses reflected positive reward prediction errors modulated by the probability of winning. We detected no significant VTA BOLD response to nonrewarding events.},

title = {Temporal autocorrelation in univariate linear modeling of FMRI data},
abstract = {In functional magnetic resonance imaging statistical analysis there are problems with accounting for temporal autocorrelations when assessing change within voxels. Techniques to date have utilized temporal filtering strategies to either shape these autocorrelations or remove them. Shaping, or "coloring," attempts to negate the effects of not accurately knowing the intrinsic autocorrelations by imposing known autocorrelation via temporal filtering. Removing the autocorrelation, or "prewhitening," gives the best linear unbiased estimator, assuming that the autocorrelation is accurately known. For single-event designs, the efficiency of the estimator is considerably higher for prewhitening compared with coloring. However, it has been suggested that sufficiently accurate estimates of the autocorrelation are currently not available to give prewhitening acceptable bias. To overcome this, we consider different ways to estimate the autocorrelation for use in prewhitening. After high-pass filtering is performed, a Tukey taper (set to smooth the spectral density more than would normally be used in spectral density estimation) performs best. Importantly, estimation is further improved by using nonlinear spatial filtering to smooth the estimated autocorrelation, but only within tissue type. Using this approach when prewhitening reduced bias to close to zero at probability levels as low as 1 x 10(-5).},

title = {Influence of reward delays on responses of dopamine neurons},
abstract = {Psychological and microeconomic studies have shown that outcome values are discounted by imposed delays. The effect, called temporal discounting, is demonstrated typically by choice preferences for sooner smaller rewards over later larger rewards. However, it is unclear whether temporal discounting occurs during the decision process when differently delayed reward outcomes are compared or during predictions of reward delays by pavlovian conditioned stimuli without choice. To address this issue, we investigated the temporal discounting behavior in a choice situation and studied the effects of reward delay on the value signals of dopamine neurons. The choice behavior confirmed hyperbolic discounting of reward value by delays on the order of seconds. Reward delay reduced the responses of dopamine neurons to pavlovian conditioned stimuli according to a hyperbolic decay function similar to that observed in choice behavior. Moreover, the stimulus responses increased with larger reward magnitudes, suggesting that both delay and magnitude constituted viable components of dopamine value signals. In contrast, dopamine responses to the reward itself increased with longer delays, possibly reflecting temporal uncertainty and partial learning. These dopamine reward value signals might serve as useful inputs for brain mechanisms involved in economic choices between delayed rewards.},

title = {Accounting for nonlinear BOLD effects in fMRI: parameter estimates and a model for prediction in rapid event-related studies},
abstract = {Nonlinear effects in fMRI BOLD data may substantially influence estimates of task-related activations, particularly in rapid event-related designs. If the BOLD response to each stimulus is assumed to be independent of the stimulation history, nonlinear interactions create a prediction error that may reduce sensitivity. When stimulus density differs among conditions, nonlinear effects can cause artifactual differences in activation. This situation can occur in rapid event-related designs or when comparing blocks of unequal lengths. We present data showing substantial nonlinear history effects for stimuli 1 s apart and use estimates of nonlinearities in response magnitude, onset time, and time to peak to form a low-dimensional parameterization of these nonlinear effects. Our estimates of nonlinearity appear relatively consistent throughout the brain, and these estimates can be used to form adjusted linear predictors for future rapid event-related fMRI studies. Adjusting the linear model for these known nonlinear effects results in a substantially better model fit. The biggest advantages to using predictors adjusted for known nonlinear effects are (1) higher sensitivity at the individual subject level of analysis, (2) better control of confounds related to nonlinear effects, and (3) more accurate estimates of design efficiency in experimental fMRI design.},

title = {Dynamic analysis of learning in behavioral experiments},
abstract = {Understanding how an animal's ability to learn relates to neural activity or is altered by lesions, different attentional states, pharmacological interventions, or genetic manipulations are central questions in neuroscience. Although learning is a dynamic process, current analyses do not use dynamic estimation methods, require many trials across many animals to establish the occurrence of learning, and provide no consensus as how best to identify when learning has occurred. We develop a state-space model paradigm to characterize learning as the probability of a correct response as a function of trial number (learning curve). We compute the learning curve and its confidence intervals using a state-space smoothing algorithm and define the learning trial as the first trial on which there is reasonable certainty (>0.95) that a subject performs better than chance for the balance of the experiment. For a range of simulated learning experiments, the smoothing algorithm estimated learning curves with smaller mean integrated squared error and identified the learning trials with greater reliability than commonly used methods. The smoothing algorithm tracked easily the rapid learning of a monkey during a single session of an association learning experiment and identified learning 2 to 4 d earlier than accepted criteria for a rat in a 47 d procedural learning experiment. Our state-space paradigm estimates learning curves for single animals, gives a precise definition of learning, and suggests a coherent statistical framework for the design and analysis of learning experiments that could reduce the number of animals and trials per animal that these studies require.},

abstract = {Confronted with a rich sensory environment, the brain must learn statistical regularities across sensory domains to construct causal models of the world. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to furnish neurophysiological evidence that statistical associations are learnt, even when task-irrelevant. Subjects performed an audio-visual target-detection task while being exposed to distractor stimuli. Unknown to them, auditory distractors predicted the presence or absence of subsequent visual distractors. We modeled incidental learning of these associations using a Rescorla-Wagner (RW) model. Activity in primary visual cortex and putamen reflected learning-dependent surprise: these areas responded progressively more to unpredicted, and progressively less to predicted visual stimuli. Critically, this prediction-error response was observed even when the absence of a visual stimulus was surprising. We investigated the underlying mechanism by embedding the RW model into a DCM to show that auditory to visual connectivity changed significantly over time as a function of prediction error. Thus, consistent with predictive coding models of perception, associative learning is mediated by prediction-error dependent changes in connectivity. These results posit a dual role for prediction-error in encoding surprise and driving associative plasticity.},

abstract = {This paper concerns temporal filtering in fMRI time-series analysis. Whitening serially correlated data is the most efficient approach to parameter estimation. However, if there is a discrepancy between the assumed and the actual correlations, whitening can render the analysis exquisitely sensitive to bias when estimating the standard error of the ensuing parameter estimates. This bias, although not expressed in terms of the estimated responses, has profound effects on any statistic used for inference. The special constraints of fMRI analysis ensure that there will always be a misspecification of the assumed serial correlations. One resolution of this problem is to filter the data to minimize bias, while maintaining a reasonable degree of efficiency. In this paper we present expressions for efficiency (of parameter estimation) and bias (in estimating standard error) in terms of assumed and actual correlation structures in the context of the general linear model. We show that: (i) Whitening strategies can result in profound bias and are therefore probably precluded in parametric fMRI data analyses. (ii) Band-pass filtering, and implicitly smoothing, has an important role in protecting against inferential bias.},

Zen meditation, in particular, is traditionally associated with a mental state of full awareness but reduced conceptual content, to be attained via a disciplined regulation of attention and bodily posture. Using fMRI and a simplified meditative condition interspersed with a lexical decision task, we investigated the neural correlates of conceptual processing during meditation in regular Zen practitioners and matched control subjects. While behavioral performance did not differ between groups, Zen practitioners displayed a reduced duration of the neural response linked to conceptual processing in regions of the default network, suggesting that meditative training may foster the ability to control the automatic cascade of semantic associations triggered by a stimulus and, by extension, to voluntarily regulate the flow of spontaneous mentation.},

PAGNONI ET AL

Assuming I am reading this correctly, Zen meditation seems to be shifting attn from  spontaneous thought processes during a somewhat alert state (which I suppose varies in saliency from moment to moment) to non-salient (mundane) sensory input (breathing, sitting, etc).  

This is, I think, in contrast to the resting state literature. During resting-state experiments, the subject is given no specific instruction, accept to stay awake - a task not to difficult given the noise of the scanner.

Perhaps these are related (The authors of this rely on it) I would argue that this is not the case.  I would argue instead that this is not a resting-state experiment.  Both subject groups are told, basically, to try and avoid the resting-state.  Had they included a normal resting state control group for comparison, the results might be more meaningful (resting-state wise).  

Additionally it could be that those attempting meditation for the first time may require significant effort leading to a delay (confusion) during the word-response portion of the task.

Also the resting-state literature is quite controversial.  Two camps exist.  The default-state camp which states that to understand in-task processing one must also understand the default (resting state).  They basically point at the high-energy demands of the resting state, and the the "unique" activation  patterns (which are far from conclusive) and conclude something important is happening.  The other camp first points out that neurovascular coupling during tasks, specific events, and during rest may be independent, and there is indeed some work to show that this is the case.  It is also worth mentioning that neurovascular coupling is quite complex, and not driven solely by neuronal spiking.  Additionally they point out that there is no need for an absolute baseline, despite the fact it simplifies simplifying experimental efforts.  Some offer a reinterpret the selective increases.  Saying basically that when nothing obviously interesting is happening, the brain searches deeper.  At least in the case of the precuneus/posterior cingulate (which are thought to be involved with monitoring the environment for emotionally salient events) there is again limited experimental support.  If this reinterpretation were correct, then it might lead to questions about overall usefulness of meditation.

title = {Conditional visuo-motor learning in primates: a key role for the basal ganglia},
abstract = {Sensory guidance of behavior often involves standard visuo-motor mapping of body movements onto objects and spatial locations. For example, looking at and reaching to grasp a glass of wine requires the mapping of the eyes and hand to the location of the glass in space, as well as the formation of a hand configuration appropriate to the shape of the glass. But our brain is far more than just a standard sensorimotor mapping machine. Through evolution, the brain of advanced mammals, in particular human and non-human primates, has acquired a formidable capacity to construct non-standard, arbitrary mapping using associations between external events and behavioral responses that bear no direct relationship. For example, we have all learned to stop at a red traffic light and to go at a green one, or to wait for a specific tone before dialing a phone number and to hang up when hearing a busy signal. These arbitrary associations are acquired through experience, thereby providing primates with a rich and flexible sensorimotor repertoire. Understanding how they are learned, and how they are recalled and used when the context requires them, has been one of the challenging issues for cognitive neuroscience. Valuable insights have been gained over the last two decades through the convergence of multiple complementary approaches. Human neuropsychology and experimental lesions in monkeys have identified a network of brain structures important for conditional sensorimotor associations, whereas imaging studies in healthy human subjects and electrophysiological recordings in awake monkeys have sought to identify the different functional processes underlying the overall function. The present review focuses on the contribution of a network linking the prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and dorsal premotor cortex, with special emphasis on results from recording experiments in monkeys. We will first review data pointing to a specific contribution of each component of the network to the performance of well-learned arbitrary visuo-motor associations, as well as data suggesting how novel associations are formed. Then we will propose a model positing that each component of the fronto-striatal network makes a specific contribution to the formation and/or execution of sensorimotor associations. In this model, the basal ganglia are thought to play a key role in linking the sensory, motor, and reward information necessary for arbitrary mapping.},

title = {Analysis and design of behavioral experiments to characterize population learning},
abstract = {In population learning studies, between-subject response differences are an important source of variance that must be characterized to identify accurately the features of the learning process common to the population. Although learning is a dynamic process, current population analyses do not use dynamic estimation methods, do not compute both population and individual learning curves, and use learning criteria that are less than optimal. We develop a state-space random effects (SSRE) model to estimate population and individual learning curves, ideal observer curves, and learning trials, and to make dynamic assessments of learning between two populations and within the same population that avoid multiple hypothesis tests. In an 80-trial study of an NMDA antagonist's effect on the ability of rats to execute a set-shift task, our dynamic assessments of learning demonstrated that both the treatment and control groups learned, yet, by trial 35, the treatment group learning was significantly impaired relative to control. We used our SSRE model in a theoretical study to evaluate the design efficiency of learning experiments in terms of the number of animals per group and number of trials per animal required to characterize learning differences between two populations. Our results demonstrated that a maximum difference in the probability of a correct response between the treatment and control group learning curves of 0.07 (0.20) would require 15 to 20 (5 to 7) animals per group in an 80 (60)-trial experiment. The SSRE model offers a practical approach to dynamic analysis of population learning and a theoretical framework for optimal design of learning experiments.},

title = {Activity in human reward-sensitive brain areas is strongly context dependent},
abstract = {Functional neuroimaging research in humans has identified a number of brain areas that are activated by the delivery of primary and secondary reinforcers. The present study investigated how activity in these reward-sensitive regions is modulated by the context in which rewards and punishments are experienced. Fourteen healthy volunteers were scanned during the performance of a simple monetary gambling task that involved a "win" condition (in which the possible outcomes were a large monetary gain, a small gain, or no gain of money) and a "lose" condition (in which the possible outcomes were a large monetary loss, a small loss, or no loss of money). We observed reward-sensitive activity in a number of brain areas previously implicated in reward processing, including the striatum, prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate, and inferior parietal lobule. Critically, activity in these reward-sensitive areas was highly sensitive to the range of possible outcomes from which an outcome was selected. In particular, these regions were activated to a comparable degree by the best outcomes in each condition-a large gain in the win condition and no loss of money in the lose condition-despite the large difference in the objective value of these outcomes. In addition, some reward-sensitive brain areas showed a binary instead of graded sensitivity to the magnitude of the outcomes from each distribution. These results provide important evidence regarding the way in which the brain scales the motivational value of events by the context in which these events occur.},

abstract = {Prediction error--a mismatch between expected and actual outcome--is critical to associative accounts of inferential learning. However, it has proven difficult to explore the effects of prediction error using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while excluding the confounding effects of stimulus novelty and incorrect responses. In this event-related fMRI study we used a three-stage experiment generating preventative- and super-learning conditions. In both cases, it was possible to generate prediction error within a causal associative learning experiment while subtracting the effects of novelty and error. We show that right lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation is sensitive to the magnitude of prediction error. Furthermore, super-learning activation in this region of PFC correlates, across subjects, with the amount learned. We thus provide direct evidence for a brain correlate of the surprise-dependent mechanisms proposed by associative accounts of causal learning. We show that activity in right lateral PFC is sensitive to the magnitude, though not the direction, of the prediction error. Furthermore, its activity is not directly explicable in terms of novelty or response errors and appears directly related to the learning that arises out of prediction error.},

title = {The neural basis of drug craving: an incentive-sensitization theory of addiction},
abstract = {This paper presents a biopsychological theory of drug addiction, the 'Incentive-Sensitization Theory'. The theory addresses three fundamental questions. The first is: why do addicts crave drugs? That is, what is the psychological and neurobiological basis of drug craving? The second is: why does drug craving persist even after long periods of abstinence? The third is whether 'wanting' drugs (drug craving) is attributable to 'liking' drugs (to the subjective pleasurable effects of drugs)? The theory posits the following. (1) Addictive drugs share the ability to enhance mesotelencephalic dopamine neurotransmission. (2) One psychological function of this neural system is to attribute 'incentive salience' to the perception and mental representation of events associated with activation of the system. Incentive salience is a psychological process that transforms the perception of stimuli, imbuing them with salience, making them attractive, 'wanted', incentive stimuli. (3) In some individuals the repeated use of addictive drugs produces incremental neuroadaptations in this neural system, rendering it increasingly and perhaps permanently, hypersensitive ('sensitized') to drugs and drug-associated stimuli. The sensitization of dopamine systems is gated by associative learning, which causes excessive incentive salience to be attributed to the act of drug taking and to stimuli associated with drug taking. It is specifically the sensitization of incentive salience, therefore, that transforms ordinary 'wanting' into excessive drug craving. (4) It is further proposed that sensitization of the neural systems responsible for incentive salience ('for wanting') can occur independently of changes in neural systems that mediate the subjective pleasurable effects of drugs (drug 'liking') and of neural systems that mediate withdrawal. Thus, sensitization of incentive salience can produce addictive behavior (compulsive drug seeking and drug taking) even if the expectation of drug pleasure or the aversive properties of withdrawal are diminished and even in the face of strong disincentives, including the loss of reputation, job, home and family. We review evidence for this view of addiction and discuss its implications for understanding the psychology and neurobiology of addiction.},

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging and a novel decision-making paradigm to dissociate the neural basis of these three computations.

abstract = {Most brain research to date have focused on studying the amplitude of evoked fMRI responses, though there has recently been an increased interest in measuring onset, peak latency and duration of the responses as well. A number of modeling procedures provide measures of the latency and duration of fMRI responses. In this work we compare several techniques that vary in their assumptions, model complexity, and interpretation. For each method, we introduce methods for estimating amplitude, peak latency, and duration and for performing inference in a multi-subject fMRI setting. We then assess the techniques' relative sensitivity and their propensity for mis-attributing task effects on one parameter (e.g., duration) to another (e.g., amplitude). Finally, we introduce methods for quantifying model misspecification and assessing bias and power-loss related to the choice of model. Overall, the results show that it is surprisingly difficult to accurately recover true task-evoked changes in BOLD signal and that there are substantial differences among models in terms of power, bias and parameter confusability. Because virtually all fMRI studies in cognitive and affective neuroscience employ these models, the results bear on the interpretation of hemodynamic response estimates across a wide variety of psychological and neuroscientific studies.},

The models were fit to the data from the two procedures simultaneously under the assumption that responses in the response signal procedure were based on a mixture of decision processes that had already terminated at response boundaries before the signal and decision processes that had not yet terminated. In the latter case, decisions were based on partial information in one variant of each model or on guessing in a second variant. Both variants of the diffusion model fit the data well and both fit better than either variant of the LCA model, although the differences in numerical goodness-of-fit measures were not large enough to allow decisive selection between the models.},

title = {Transient activation of midbrain dopamine neurons by reward risk},
abstract = {Dopamine neurons of the ventral midbrain are activated transiently following stimuli that predict future reward. This response has been shown to signal the expected value of future reward, and there is strong evidence that it drives positive reinforcement of stimuli and actions associated with reward in accord with reinforcement learning models. Behavior is also influenced by reward uncertainty, or risk, but it is not known whether the transient response of dopamine neurons is sensitive to reward risk. To investigate this, monkeys were trained to associate distinct visual stimuli with certain or uncertain volumes of juice of nearly the same expected value. In a choice task, monkeys preferred the stimulus predicting an uncertain (risky) reward outcome. In a Pavlovian task, in which the neuronal responses to each stimulus could be measured in isolation, it was found that dopamine neurons were more strongly activated by the stimulus associated with reward risk. Given extensive evidence that dopamine drives reinforcement, these results strongly suggest that dopamine neurons can reinforce risk-seeking behavior (gambling), at least under certain conditions. Risk-seeking behavior has the virtue of promoting exploration and learning, and these results support the hypothesis that dopamine neurons represent the value of exploration.},

title = {Utilizing temporal information in fMRI decoding: Classifier using kernel regression methods},
abstract = {This paper describes a general kernel regression approach to predict experimental conditions from activity patterns acquired with functional magnetic resonance image (fMRI). The standard approach is to use classifiers that predict conditions from activity patterns. Our approach involves training different regression machines for each experimental condition, so that a predicted temporal profile is computed for each condition. A decision function is then used to classify the responses from the testing volumes into the corresponding category, by comparing the predicted temporal profile elicited by each event, against a canonical hemodynamic response function. This approach utilizes the temporal information in the fMRI signal and maintains more training samples in order to improve the classification accuracy over an existing strategy. This paper also introduces efficient techniques of temporal compaction, which operate directly on kernel matrices for kernel classification algorithms such as the support vector machine (SVM). Temporal compacting can convert the kernel computed from each fMRI volume directly into the kernel computed from beta-maps, average of volumes or spatial-temporal kernel. The proposed method was applied to three different datasets. The first one is a block-design experiment with three conditions of image stimuli. The method outperformed the SVM classifiers of three different types of temporal compaction in single-subject leave-one-block-out cross-validation. Our method achieved 100% classification accuracy for six of the subjects and an average of 94% accuracy across all 16 subjects, exceeding the best SVM classification result, which was 83% accuracy (p=0.008). The second dataset is also a block-design experiment with two conditions of visual attention (left or right). Our method yielded 96% accuracy and SVM yielded 92% (p=0.005). The third dataset is from a fast event-related experiment with two categories of visual objects. Our method achieved 77% accuracy, compared with 72% using SVM (p=0.0006).},

title = {Rule learning and reward contingency are associated with dissociable patterns of dopamine activation in the rat prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and dorsal striatum},
abstract = {The midbrain dopamine system has been ascribed roles in reward expectancy, error detection, prediction, and memory. However, these theories typically do not differentiate between dopamine response and action in different forebrain terminal fields. We measured dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), nucleus accumbens (NAc), and dorsal striatum (DS) of rats exposed to the same maze apparatus under three behavioral conditions: a set-shift task in which reward depended on discrimination learning and extradimensional set-shifting, a yoked condition in which reward was intermittent and not under the control of the subject, and a "reward-retrieval" variant in which reward was certain on every trial. We found dissociable patterns of dopamine release associated with learning, uncertainty, and reward. Dopamine increased in all three regions when reward was contingent on rule learning and shifting or was uncertain. These increases were sustained after behavior. There was a significant correlation between the magnitude of increase in PFC dopamine and the rapidity with which rats shifted between discrimination rules. In the yoke condition, in which the receipt of reward was always uncertain, the opposite relationship between dopamine levels and likelihood of reward was observed. Predictable, noncontingent reward was associated with increased dopamine levels in the NAc and DS. In contrast, PFC dopamine did not increase significantly above baseline levels. Thus, the dopaminergic projections to the PFC and nucleus accumbens were selectively, yet differentially, activated in situations of uncertainty and cognitive demand, whereas the dopaminergic projection to the DS responded independently of task differences in learning and reward.},

abstract = {The mesocorticolimbic dopamine system is essential for cognitive and emotive brain functions and is thus an important target in major brain diseases like schizophrenia, drug addiction, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. However, the cellular basis for the diversity in behavioral functions and associated dopamine-release pattern within the mesocorticolimbic system has remained unclear. Here, we report the identification of a type of dopaminergic neuron within the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system with unconventional fast-firing properties and small DAT/TH mRNA expression ratios that selectively projects to prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens core and medial shell as well as to basolateral amygdala. In contrast, well-described conventional slow-firing dopamine midbrain neurons only project to the lateral shell of the nucleus accumbens and the dorsolateral striatum. Among this dual dopamine midbrain system defined in this study by converging anatomical, electrophysiological, and molecular properties, mesoprefrontal dopaminergic neurons are unique, as only they do not possess functional somatodendritic Girk2-coupled dopamine D2 autoreceptors.},

title = {Prefrontal-subcortical pathways mediating successful emotion regulation},
abstract = {Although prefrontal cortex has been implicated in the cognitive regulation of emotion, the cortical-subcortical interactions that mediate this ability remain poorly understood. To address this issue, we identified a right ventrolateral prefrontal region (vlPFC) whose activity correlated with reduced negative emotional experience during cognitive reappraisal of aversive images. We then applied a pathway-mapping analysis on subcortical regions to locate mediators of the association between vlPFC activity and reappraisal success (i.e., reductions in reported emotion). Results identified two separable pathways that together explained approximately 50% of the reported variance in self-reported emotion: (1) a path through nucleus accumbens that predicted greater reappraisal success, and (2) a path through ventral amygdala that predicted reduced reappraisal success (i.e., more negative emotion). These results provide direct evidence that vlPFC is involved in both the generation and regulation of emotion through different subcortical pathways, suggesting a general role for this region in appraisal processes.},

title = {Brain mediators of predictive cue effects on perceived pain},
abstract = {Information about upcoming pain strongly influences pain experience in experimental and clinical settings, but little is known about the brain mechanisms that link expectation and experience. To identify the pathways by which informational cues influence perception, analyses must jointly consider both the effects of cues on brain responses and the relationship between brain responses and changes in reported experience. Our task and analysis strategy were designed to test these relationships. Auditory cues elicited expectations for barely painful or highly painful thermal stimulation, and we assessed how cues influenced human subjects' pain reports and brain responses to matched levels of noxious heat using functional magnetic resonance imaging. We used multilevel mediation analysis to identify brain regions that (1) are modulated by predictive cues, (2) predict trial-to-trial variations in pain reports, and (3) formally mediate the relationship between cues and reported pain. Cues influenced heat-evoked responses in most canonical pain-processing regions, including both medial and lateral pain pathways. Effects on several regions correlated with pretask expectations, suggesting that expectancy plays a prominent role. A subset of pain-processing regions, including anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, and thalamus, formally mediated cue effects on pain. Effects on these regions were in turn mediated by cue-evoked anticipatory activity in the medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and ventral striatum, areas not previously directly implicated in nociception. These results suggest that activity in pain-processing regions reflects a combination of nociceptive input and top-down information related to expectations, and that anticipatory processes in OFC and striatum may play a key role in modulating pain processing.},

title = {Anticipation of novelty recruits reward system and hippocampus while promoting recollection},
abstract = {The dopaminergic midbrain, which comprises the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA), plays a central role in reward processing. This region is also activated by novel stimuli, raising the possibility that novelty and reward have shared functional properties. It is currently unclear whether functional aspects of reward processing in the SN/VTA, namely, activation by unexpected rewards and cues that predict reward, also characterize novelty processing. To address this question, we conducted an fMRI experiment during which subjects viewed symbolic cues that predicted either novel or familiar images of scenes with 75% validity. We show that SN/VTA was activated by cues predicting novel images as well as by unexpected novel images that followed familiarity-predictive cues, an 'unexpected novelty' response. The hippocampus, a region implicated in detecting and encoding novel stimuli, showed an anticipatory novelty response but differed from the response profile of SN/VTA in responding at outcome to expected and 'unexpected' novelty. In a behavioral extension of the experiment, recollection increased relative to familiarity when comparing delayed recognition memory for anticipated novel stimuli with unexpected novel stimuli. These data reveal commonalities in SN/VTA responses to anticipating reward and anticipating novel stimuli. We suggest that this anticipatory response codes a motivational exploratory novelty signal that, together with anticipatory activation of the hippocampus, leads to enhanced encoding of novel events. In more general terms, the data suggest that dopaminergic processing of novelty might be important in driving exploration of new environments.},

abstract = {Vascular responses to neural activity are exploited as the basis of a number of brain imaging techniques. The vascular response is thought to be too slow to resolve the temporal sequence of events involved in cognitive tasks, and hence, imaging studies of mental chronometry have relied on techniques such as the evoked potential. Using rapid functional MRI (fMRI) of single trials of two simple behavioral tasks, we demonstrate that while the microvascular response to the onset of neural activity is delayed consistently by several seconds, the relative timing between the onset of the fMRI responses in different brain areas appears preserved. We examined a number of parameters that characterize the fMRI response and determined that its onset time is best defined by the inflection point from the resting baseline. We have found that fMRI onset latencies determined in this manner correlate well with independently measurable parameters of the tasks such as reaction time or stimulus presentation time and can be used to determine the origin of processing delays during cognitive or perceptual tasks with a temporal accuracy of tens of milliseconds and spatial resolution of millimeters.},

title = {Dopamine: a potential substrate for synaptic plasticity and memory mechanisms},
abstract = {It is only recently that a number of studies on synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and other brain areas have considered that a heterosynaptic modulatory input could be recruited as well as the coincident firing of pre- and post-synaptic neurons. So far, the strongest evidence for such a regulation has been attributed to dopaminergic (DA) systems but other modulatory pathways have also been considered to influence synaptic plasticity. This review will focus on dopamine contribution to synaptic plasticity in different brain areas (hippocampus, striatum and prefrontal cortex) with, for each region, a few lines on the distribution of DA projections and receptors. New insights into the possible mechanisms underlying these plastic changes will be considered. The contribution of various DA systems in certain forms of learning and memory will be reviewed with recent advances supporting the hypothesis of similar cellular mechanisms underlying DA regulation of synaptic plasticity and memory processes in which the cyclic adenosine monophosphate/protein kinase A (cAMP/PKA) pathway has a potential role. To summarize, endogenous DA, which depends on the activity patterns of DA midbrain neurons in freely moving animals, appears as a key regulator in specific synaptic changes observed at certain stages of learning and memory and of synaptic plasticity.},

title = {Addiction: beyond dopamine reward circuitry},
abstract = {Dopamine (DA) is considered crucial for the rewarding effects of drugs of abuse, but its role in addiction is much less clear. This review focuses on studies that used PET to characterize the brain DA system in addicted subjects. These studies have corroborated in humans the relevance of drug-induced fast DA increases in striatum [including nucleus accumbens (NAc)] in their rewarding effects but have unexpectedly shown that in addicted subjects, drug-induced DA increases (as well as their subjective reinforcing effects) are markedly blunted compared with controls. In contrast, addicted subjects show significant DA increases in striatum in response to drug-conditioned cues that are associated with self-reports of drug craving and appear to be of a greater magnitude than the DA responses to the drug. We postulate that the discrepancy between the expectation for the drug effects (conditioned responses) and the blunted pharmacological effects maintains drug taking in an attempt to achieve the expected reward. Also, whether tested during early or protracted withdrawal, addicted subjects show lower levels of D2 receptors in striatum (including NAc), which are associated with decreases in baseline activity in frontal brain regions implicated in salience attribution (orbitofrontal cortex) and inhibitory control (anterior cingulate gyrus), whose disruption results in compulsivity and impulsivity. These results point to an imbalance between dopaminergic circuits that underlie reward and conditioning and those that underlie executive function (emotional control and decision making), which we postulate contributes to the compulsive drug use and loss of control in addiction.},

Here, we show a dissociation between medial temporal and basal ganglia damage using a latent learning task, in which prior exposure to cues, uncorrelated with each other, slows subsequent learning of an association between them. Consistent with prior work, we found a robust exposure effect in healthy controls, with exposed controls learning more slowly than non-exposed controls. This effect was abolished in medial temporal amnesia: both exposed and non-exposed amnesic patients learned at the same speed. A group of patients with basal ganglia damage due to Parkinson's disease showed a reversal of the effect: exposed subjects learned faster than non-exposed subjects.

title = {Distinct Hippocampal and Basal Ganglia Contributions to Probabilistic Learning and Reversal},
abstract = {Abstract The hippocampus and the basal ganglia are thought to play fundamental and distinct roles in learning and memory, supporting two dissociable memory systems. Interestingly, however, the hippocampus and the basal ganglia have each, separately, been implicated as necessary for reversal learning-the ability to adaptively change a response when previously learned stimulus-outcome contingencies are reversed. Here, we compared the contribution of the hippocampus and the basal ganglia to distinct aspects of learning and reversal. Amnesic subjects with selective hippocampal damage, Parkinson's subjects with disrupted basal ganglia function, and healthy controls were tested on a novel probabilistic learning and reversal paradigm. In this task, reversal can be achieved in two ways: Subjects can reverse a previously learned response, or, they can select a new cue during the reversal phase, effectively "opting out" of the reversal. We found that both patient groups were intact at initial learning, but differed in their ability to reverse. Amnesic subjects failed to reverse, and continued to use the same cue and response learned before the reversal. Parkinson's subjects, by contrast, opted out of the reversal by learning a new cue-outcome association. These results suggest that both the hippocampus and the basal ganglia support reversal learning, but in different ways. The basal ganglia are necessary for learning a new response when a previously learned response is no longer rewarding. The failure of the amnesic subjects to reverse their response or to learn a new cue is consistent with a more general role for the hippocampus in configural learning, and suggests it may also support the ability to respond to changes in cue-outcome contingencies.},

Affected individuals have severe motor disability described by prominent extrapyramidal features that are characteristic of dysfunction of the motor circuits of the basal ganglia. They also display disturbances of ocular motility, cognition, and behavioral control that may reflect disruption of other circuits of the basal ganglia. Though neuropathologic studies of autopsy specimens have revealed no obvious neuroanatomical abnormalities in LND, neurochemical studies have demonstrated 60-90% reductions in the dopamine content of the basal ganglia. In addition, recent PET studies have documented significant reductions in dopamine transporters and {\$}[{\$}18F{\$}]{\$}fluorodopa uptake in the basal ganglia. These findings support the proposal that many of the neurobehavioral features of LND might be related to dysfunction of the basal ganglia.},

The occurrence of time-locked activations is formulated in terms of the general linear model, i.e., multiple linear regression. This permits the use of established statistical techniques that correct for multiple comparisons in the context of spatially smooth and serially correlated data. Responses are modelled using event-related temporal basis functions. Inferences are then made about all components of the model, using the F-ratio at all voxels in the image, to produce a statistical parametric map (SPM{F}). This method allows for the experimental design to relate the timing of events to the acquisition of data to give a temporal resolution (with respect to the event-related response) far better than the scanning repeat time.},

title = {Separating event-related BOLD components within trials: the partial-trial design revisited},
abstract = {Many event-related fMRI designs involve multiple successive events occurring within a trial, spaced closely in time (e.g., in cued set-shifting paradigms). Yet, it is notoriously difficult to separate the activation components to these sequentially ordered events, given the long evolution time of the BOLD response. One approach to deal with this problem is to omit the second of two successive events (S1 and S2) in a certain proportion of 'partial S1-only' trials. The present article describes a novel method that extends the basic partial-trial design in several ways. As a central new feature it introduces two different delay intervals between S1 onset and S2 presentation, or, in case of S1-only trials, S2 omission. The analysis is based on three BOLD response regressors, one synchronized with S1 onset for short S1-S2 delay trials, another one synchronized with S1 onset for long S1-S2 delay trials, and a third synchronized with S2 onset. The two estimated S1-related activation time courses are then assessed by 'temporal profiling' based on the parameterization of onset latencies, peak latencies, and the area under the curves. Based on this information it is possible (1) to distinguish transient activity elicited with S1 onset from delay-related activity and (2) to identify the activation profile associated with possible 'nogo-type' activity caused by S2 omission. Despite these two new important possibilities, some caution is still advised when interpreting data from the proposed partial-trial design. Yet, in contrast to previous methods, it is possible to identify ambiguous data patterns and, by following an explicit decision scheme, to avoid erroneous conclusions.},

abstract = {Dopamine (DA) is believed to play a fundamental role in reward processes. Virtually all drugs of abuse activate dopaminergic systems, as do "natural" rewards such as sexual interaction and food. Sweet-tasting solutions, for example, are a well characterized natural reward. In the present experiments, we used mice that cannot make DA (DD mice) to test the hypothesis that DA is necessary for reward. Sucrose preference, assessed with a computerized "lickometer," was used to determine whether DD mice respond preferentially for rewarding stimuli. DD mice preferentially chose sucrose over water, and also preferred the noncaloric sweetener saccharin. Furthermore, the rate of licking, bout size, and length were greater in DD mice drinking sweets than in controls. These data refute the necessity of DA for the reward processes manifested by sucrose preference. However, DD mice initiated licking less frequently than control mice and had fewer total licks. We suggest that DD mice have a deficit of goal-directed behavior that is not specific to reward processes. Lastly, juvenile DD mice demonstrate robust sucrose preference before experience with food in the presence of DA. Thus, DA is not required for mice to learn to consume sweet solutions preferentially. We conclude that DA is not required to find the sweet tastes of sucrose or saccharin rewarding.},

abstract = {The loss of striatal dopamine (DA) in Parkinson's disease (PD) models triggers a cell-type-specific reduction in the density of dendritic spines in D(2) receptor-expressing striatopallidal medium spiny neurons (D(2) MSNs). How the intrinsic properties of MSN dendrites, where the vast majority of DA receptors are found, contribute to this adaptation is not clear. To address this question, two-photon laser scanning microscopy (2PLSM) was performed in patch-clamped mouse MSNs identified in striatal slices by expression of green fluorescent protein (eGFP) controlled by DA receptor promoters. These studies revealed that single backpropagating action potentials (bAPs) produced more reliable elevations in cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration at distal dendritic locations in D(2) MSNs than at similar locations in D(1) receptor-expressing striatonigral MSNs (D(1) MSNs). In both cell types, the dendritic Ca(2+) entry elicited by bAPs was enhanced by pharmacological blockade of Kv4, but not Kv1 K(+) channels. Local application of DA depressed dendritic bAP-evoked Ca(2+) transients, whereas application of ACh increased these Ca(2+) transients in D(2) MSNs, but not in D(1) MSNs. After DA depletion, bAP-evoked Ca(2+) transients were enhanced in distal dendrites and spines in D(2) MSNs. Together, these results suggest that normally D(2) MSN dendrites are more excitable than those of D(1) MSNs and that DA depletion exaggerates this asymmetry, potentially contributing to adaptations in PD models.},

title = {The impact of temporal regularization on estimates of the BOLD hemodynamic response function: a comparative analysis},
abstract = {In fMRI data analysis it has been shown that for a wide range of situations the hemodynamic response function (HRF) can be reasonably characterized as the impulse response function of a linear and time invariant system. An accurate and robust extraction of the HRF is essential to infer quantitative information about the relative timing of the neuronal events in different brain regions. When no assumptions are made about the HRF shape, it is most commonly estimated using time windowed averaging or a least squares estimated general linear model based on either Fourier or delta basis functions. Recently, regularization methods have been employed to increase the estimation efficiency of the HRF; typically these methods produce more accurate HRF estimates than the least squares approach [Goutte, C., Nielsen, F.A., Hansen, L.K., 2000. Modeling the Haemodynamic Response in fMRI Using Smooth FIR Filters. IEEE Trans. Med. Imag. 19(12), 1188-1201.]. Here, we use simulations to clarify the relative merit of temporal regularization based methods compared to the least squares methods with respect to the accuracy of estimating certain characteristics of the HRF such as time to peak (TTP), height (HR) and width (W) of the response. We implemented a Bayesian approach proposed by Marrelec et al. [Marrelec, G., Benali, H., Ciuciu, P., Pelegrini-Issac, M., Poline, J.-B., 2003. Robust Estimation of the Hemodynamic Response Function in Event-Related BOLD fMRI Using Basic Physiological Information. Hum. Brain Mapp. 19, 1-17., Marrelec, G., Benali, H., Ciuciu, P., Poline, J.B. Bayesian estimation of the hemodynamic of the hemodynamic response function in functional MRI. In: R. F, editor; 2001; Melville. p 229-247.] and its deterministic counterpart based on a combination of Tikhonov regularization [Tikhonov, A.N., Arsenin, V.Y., 1977. Solution of ill-posed problems. Washington DC: W.H. Winston.] and generalized cross-validation (GCV) [Wahba, G., 1990. Spline Models for Observational Data. Philadelphia: SIAM.] for selecting the regularization parameter. The performance of both methods is compared with least square estimates as a function of temporal resolution, color and strength of the noise, and the type of stimulus sequences used. In almost all situations, under the considered assumptions (e.g. linearity, time invariance and smooth HRF), the regularization-based techniques more accurately characterize the HRF compared to the least-squares method. Our results clarify the effects of temporal resolution, noise color, and experimental design on the accuracy of HRF estimation.},

abstract = {Midbrain dopamine and striatal tonically active neurons (TANs, presumed acetylcholine interneurons) signal behavioral significance of environmental events. Since striatal dopamine and acetylcholine affect plasticity of cortico-striatal transmission and are both crucial to learning, they may serve as teachers in the basal ganglia circuits. We recorded from both neuronal populations in monkeys performing a probabilistic instrumental conditioning task. Both neuronal types respond robustly to reward-related events. Although different events yielded responses with different latencies, the responses of the two populations coincided, indicating integration at the target level. Yet, while the dopamine neurons' response reflects mismatch between expectation and outcome in the positive domain, the TANs are invariant to reward predictability. Finally, TAN pairs are synchronized, compared to a minority of dopamine neuron pairs. We conclude that the striatal cholinergic and dopaminergic systems carry distinct messages by different means, which can be integrated differently to shape the basal ganglia responses to reward-related events.},

abstract = {Many behavioral paradigms involve temporally overlapping sensory, cognitive, and motor components within a single trial. The complex interplay among these factors makes it desirable to separate the components of the total response without assumptions about shape of the underlying hemodynamic response. We present a method that does this. Four conditions were studied in four subjects to validate the method. Two conditions involved rapid event-related studies, one with a low-contrast (5%) flickering checkerboard and another with a high-contrast (95%) checkerboard. In the third condition, the same high-contrast checkerboard was presented with widely spaced trials. Finally, multicomponent trials were formed from temporally adjacent low-contrast and high-contrast stimuli. These trials were presented as a rapid event-related study. Low-contrast stimuli presented in isolation (partial trials) made it possible to uniquely estimate both the low-contrast and high-contrast responses. These estimated responses matched those measured in the first three conditions, thereby validating the method. Nonlinear interactions between adjacent low-contrast and high-contrast responses were shown to be significant but weak in two of the four subjects.},

abstract = {Mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons are thought to serve as a final common neural pathway for mediating reinforcement processes. However, several recent findings have challenged the view that mesolimbic dopamine has a crucial role in the maintenance of reinforcement processes, or the subjective rewarding actions of natural rewards and drugs of abuse. Instead, there is growing evidence that dopamine is involved in the formation of associations between salient contextual stimuli and internal rewarding or aversive events. This evidence suggests that dopaminergic-neuron activation aids the organism in learning to recognize stimuli associated with such events. Thus, mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons have an important function in the acquisition of behavior reinforced by natural reward and drug stimuli. Furthermore, long-lasting neuroadaptive changes in mesolimbic dopamine-mediated transmission that develop during chronic drug use might contribute to compulsive drug-seeking behavior and relapse.},

title = {Top-Down Attentional Control in Parkinson's Disease: Salient Considerations},
abstract = {Abstract Cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) has been hypothesized to reflect a failure of cortical control. In keeping with this hypothesis, some of the cognitive deficits in PD resemble those seen in patients with lesions in the lateral pFC, which has been associated with top-down attentional control. However, there is no direct evidence for a failure of top-down control mechanisms in PD. Here we fill this gap by demonstrating disproportionate control by bottom-up attention to dimensional salience during attentional set shifting. Patients needed significantly more trials to criterion than did controls when shifting to a low-salient dimension while, remarkably, needing significantly fewer trials to criterion than did controls when shifting to a high-salient dimension. Thus, attention was captured by bottom-up attention to salient information to a greater extent in patients than in controls. The results provide a striking reinterpretation of prior set-shifting data and provide the first direct evidence for a failure of top-down attentional control, resembling that seen after catecholamine depletion in the pFC.},

title = {Independent coding of movement direction and reward prediction by single pallidal neurons},
abstract = {Associating action with its reward value is a basic ability needed by adaptive organisms and requires the convergence of limbic, motor, and associative information. To chart the basal ganglia (BG) involvement in this association, we recorded the activity of 61 well isolated neurons in the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe) of two monkeys performing a probabilistic visuomotor task. Our results indicate that most (96%) neurons responded to multiple phases of the task. The activity of many (34%) pallidal neurons was modulated solely by direction of movement, and the activity of only a few (3%) pallidal neurons was modulated exclusively by reward prediction. However, the activity of a large number (41%) of single pallidal neurons was comodulated by both expected trial outcome and direction of arm movement. The information carried by the neuronal activity of single pallidal neurons dynamically changed as the trial progressed. The activity was predominantly modulated by both outcome prediction and future movement direction at the beginning of trials and became modulated mainly by movement-direction toward the end of trials. GPe neurons can either increase or decrease their discharge rate in response to predicted future reward. The effects of movement-direction and reward probability on neural activity are linearly summed and thus reflect two independent modulations of pallidal activity. We propose that GPe neurons are uniquely suited for independent processing of a multitude of parameters. This is enabled by the funnel-structure characteristic of the BG architecture, as well as by the anatomical and physiological properties of GPe neurons.},

title = {An empirical comparison of SPM preprocessing parameters to the analysis of fMRI data},
abstract = {We present the results from two sets of Monte Carlo simulations aimed at evaluating the robustness of some preprocessing parameters of SPM99 for the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Statistical robustness was estimated by implementing parametric and nonparametric simulation approaches based on the images obtained from an event-related fMRI experiment. Simulated datasets were tested for combinations of the following parameters: basis function, global scaling, low-pass filter, high-pass filter and autoregressive modeling of serial autocorrelation. Based on single-subject SPM analysis, we derived the following conclusions that may serve as a guide for initial analysis of fMRI data using SPM99: (1) The canonical hemodynamic response function is a more reliable basis function to model the fMRI time series than HRF with time derivative. (2) Global scaling should be avoided since it may significantly decrease the power depending on the experimental design. (3) The use of a high-pass filter may be beneficial for event-related designs with fixed interstimulus intervals. (4) When dealing with fMRI time series with short interstimulus intervals (<8 s), the use of first-order autoregressive model is recommended over a low-pass filter (HRF) because it reduces the risk of inferential bias while providing a relatively good power. For datasets with interstimulus intervals longer than 8 seconds, temporal smoothing is not recommended since it decreases power. While the generalizability of our results may be limited, the methods we employed can be easily implemented by other scientists to determine the best parameter combination to analyze their data.},

abstract = {Individuals make choices and prioritize goals using complex processes that assign value to rewards and associated stimuli. During Pavlovian learning, previously neutral stimuli that predict rewards can acquire motivational properties, becoming attractive and desirable incentive stimuli. However, whether a cue acts solely as a predictor of reward, or also serves as an incentive stimulus, differs between individuals. Thus, individuals vary in the degree to which cues bias choice and potentially promote maladaptive behaviour. Here we use rats that differ in the incentive motivational properties they attribute to food cues to probe the role of the neurotransmitter dopamine in stimulus-reward learning. We show that intact dopamine transmission is not required for all forms of learning in which reward cues become effective predictors. Rather, dopamine acts selectively in a form of stimulus-reward learning in which incentive salience is assigned to reward cues. In individuals with a propensity for this form of learning, reward cues come to powerfully motivate and control behaviour. This work provides insight into the neurobiology of a form of stimulus-reward learning that confers increased susceptibility to disorders of impulse control.},

This framework is based on computational tradeoffs that arise in neural network models, where achieving one type of learning function requires very different parameters from those necessary to achieve another form of learning. For example, we dissociate the hippocampus from cortex with respect to general levels of activity, learning rate, and level of overlap between activation patterns. Similarly, the frontal cortex and associated basal ganglia system have important neural specializations not required of the posterior cortex system. Taken together, this overall cognitive architecture, which has been implemented in functioning computational models, provides a rich and often subtle means of explaining a wide range of behavioral and cognitive neuroscience data. Here, we summarize recent results in the domains of recognition memory, contextual fear conditioning, effects of basal ganglia lesions on stimulus-response and place learning, and flexible responding.},

title = {Bidirectional Activity-Dependent Plasticity at Corticostriatal Synapses},
abstract = {Corticostriatal projections originate from the entire cerebral cortex and provide the major source of glutamatergic inputs to the basal ganglia. Despite the importance of corticostriatal connections in sensorimotor learning and cognitive functions, plasticity forms at these synapses remain strongly debated. Using a corticostriatal slice preserving the connections between the somatosensory cortex and the target striatal cells, we report the induction of both non-Hebbian and Hebbian forms of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) on striatal output neurons (SONs). LTP and LTD can be induced selectively by different stimulation patterns (high- frequency trains vs low-frequency pulses) and were evoked with similar efficiency in non-Hebbian and Hebbian modes. Combination of LTP--LTD and LTD--LTP sequences revealed that bidirectional plasticity occurs at the same SONs and provides efficient homeostatic mechanisms leading to a resetting of corticostriatal synapses avoiding synaptic saturation. The effect of temporal relationship between cortical stimulation and SON activity was assessed using spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) protocols. An LTP was observed when an action potential was triggered in the striatal neuron before the cortical stimulus, and, conversely, an LTD was induced when the striatal neuron discharge was triggered after the cortical stimulation. Such STDP was reversed when compared with those described so far in other mammalian brain structures. This mechanism may be essential for the role of the striatum in learning of motor sequences in which sensory and motor events are associated in a precise time sequence.},
annote = {C. Seger sent this to me w/ the comment: "They showed that dopa is not necessary for LTP." This may be true, but after reading it: 1) I cannot tell if the SNc was intact in their slices if so D may have been released 2) If dopa level are locally modulated by glu (including transporter mediated rel), as shown in \cite{kulagina:2001aa} and \cite{borland:2004aa}, then Dopa could still be present. 3) they attempted no pharmacology, knocking out DRs 4) the authors do not mention that their results are Dopa independent},

abstract = {This review outlines some of the main conclusions about the contributions of the orbitofrontal cortex to reward learning and decision making arising from functional neuroimaging studies in humans. It will be argued that human orbitofrontal cortex is involved in a number of distinct functions: signaling the affective value of stimuli as they are perceived, encoding expectations of future reward, and updating these expectations, either by making use of prediction error signals generated in the midbrain, or by using knowledge of the rules or structure of the decision problem. It will also be suggested that this region contributes to the decision making process itself, by encoding signals that inform an individual about what action to take next. Evidence for functional specialization within orbitofrontal cortex in terms of valence will also be evaluated, and the possible contributions of the orbitofrontal cortex in representing the values of actions as well as that of stimuli will be discussed. Finally, some of the outstanding questions for future neuroimaging research of orbitofrontal cortex function will be highlighted.},

title = {Choice selection and reward anticipation: an fMRI study},
abstract = {We examined neural activations during decision-making using fMRI paired with the wheel of fortune task, a newly developed two-choice decision-making task with probabilistic monetary gains. In particular, we assessed the impact of high-reward/risk events relative to low-reward/risk events on neural activations during choice selection and during reward anticipation. Seventeen healthy adults completed the study. We found, in line with predictions, that (i) the selection phase predominantly recruited regions involved in visuo-spatial attention (occipito-parietal pathway), conflict (anterior cingulate), manipulation of quantities (parietal cortex), and preparation for action (premotor area), whereas the anticipation phase prominently recruited regions engaged in reward processes (ventral striatum); and (ii) high-reward/risk conditions relative to low-reward/risk conditions were associated with a greater neural response in ventral striatum during selection, though not during anticipation. Following an a priori ROI analysis focused on orbitofrontal cortex, we observed orbitofrontal cortex activation (BA 11 and 47) during selection (particularly to high-risk/reward options), and to a more limited degree, during anticipation. These findings support the notion that (1) distinct, although overlapping, pathways subserve the processes of selection and anticipation in a two-choice task of probabilistic monetary reward; (2) taking a risk and awaiting the consequence of a risky decision seem to affect neural activity differently in selection and anticipation; and thus (3) common structures, including the ventral striatum, are modulated differently by risk/reward during selection and anticipation.},

title = {Optimal experimental design for event-related fMRI},
abstract = {An important challenge in the design and analysis of event-related or single-trial functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments is to optimize statistical efficiency, i.e., the accuracy with which the event-related hemodynamic response to different stimuli can be estimated for a given amount of imaging time. Several studies have suggested that using a fixed inter-stimulus-interval (ISI) of at least 15 sec results in optimal statistical efficiency or power and that using shorter ISIs results in a severe loss of power. In contrast, recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using ISIs as short as 500 ms while still maintaining considerable efficiency or power. Here, we attempt to resolve this apparent contradiction by a quantitative analysis of the relative efficiency afforded by different event-related experimental designs. This analysis shows that statistical efficiency falls off dramatically as the ISI gets sufficiently short, if the ISI is kept fixed for all trials. However, if the ISI is properly jittered or randomized from trial to trial, the efficiency improves monotonically with decreasing mean ISI. Importantly, the efficiency afforded by such variable ISI designs can be more than 10 times greater than that which can be achieved by fixed ISI designs. These results further demonstrate the feasibility of using identical experimental designs with fMRI and electro-/magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG) without sacrificing statistical power or efficiency of either technique, thereby facilitating comparison and integration across imaging modalities.},

abstract = {The striatum has been widely implicated in cognition, but a precise understanding of its role remains elusive. Here we present converging evidence for the role of the striatum in feedback-based learning. In a prior functional imaging study, healthy controls showed striatal activity during a feedback-based learning task, which was decreased when the same task was learned without feedback. In the present study, we show that individuals with striatal dysfunction due to Parkinson's disease are impaired on the feedback-based task, but not on a non-feedback version of the same task. Parkinson's patients and controls also used different learning strategies depending on feedback structure. This study provides direct behavioural evidence from humans that cortico-striatal systems are necessary for feedback-based learning on a cognitive task. These findings also link between learning impairments in Parkinson's disease and the physiological and computational evidence for the role of midbrain dopaminergic systems in feedback processing.},

title = {Midbrain dopaminergic neurons and striatal cholinergic interneurons encode the difference between reward and aversive events at different epochs of probabilistic classical conditioning trials},
abstract = {Midbrain dopaminergic neurons (DANs) typically increase their discharge rate in response to appetitive predictive cues and outcomes, whereas striatal cholinergic tonically active interneurons (TANs) decrease their rate. This may indicate that the activity of TANs and DANs is negatively correlated and that TANs can broaden the basal ganglia reinforcement teaching signal, for instance by encoding worse than predicted events. We studied the activity of 106 DANs and 180 TANs of two monkeys recorded during the performance of a classical conditioning task with cues predicting the probability of food, neutral, and air puff outcomes. DANs responded to all cues with elevations of discharge rate, whereas TANs depressed their discharge rate. Nevertheless, although dopaminergic responses to appetitive cues were larger than their responses to neutral or aversive cues, the TAN responses were more similar. Both TANs and DANs responded faster to an air puff than to a food outcome; however, DANs responded with a discharge elevation, whereas the TAN responses included major negative and positive deflections. Finally, food versus air puff omission was better encoded by TANs. In terms of the activity of single neurons with distinct responses to the different behavioral events, both DANs and TANs were more strongly modulated by reward than by aversive related events and better reflected the probability of reward than aversive outcome. Thus, TANs and DANs encode the task episodes differentially. The DANs encode mainly the cue and outcome delivery, whereas the TANs mainly encode outcome delivery and omission at termination of the behavioral trial episode.},

title = {Response processes in information-integration category learning},
abstract = {Much recent evidence suggests that human category learning is mediated by multiple systems. Evidence suggests that at least one of these depends on procedural learning within the basal ganglia. Information-integration categorization tasks are thought to load heavily on this procedural-learning system. The results of several previous studies were interpreted to suggest that response positions are learned in information-integration tasks. This hypothesis was tested in two experiments. Experiment 1 showed that information-integration category learning was slowed but not disrupted when the spatial location of the responses varied randomly across trials. Experiment 2 showed that information-integration learning was impaired if category membership was signaled by responding to a Yes/No question and the category label had no consistent spatial location. These results suggest that information-integration category learning does not require consistent response locations. In these experiments, a consistent association between a category and a response feature was sufficient. The implication of these results for the neurobiology of information-integration category learning is discussed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The ability to select an action by considering both delays and amount of reward outcome is critical for maximizing long-term benefits. Although previous animal experiments on impulsivity have suggested a role of serotonin in behaviors requiring prediction of delayed rewards, the underlying neural mechanism is unclear. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To elucidate the role of serotonin in the evaluation of delayed rewards, we performed a functional brain imaging experiment in which subjects chose small-immediate or large-delayed liquid rewards under dietary regulation of tryptophan, a precursor of serotonin. A model-based analysis revealed that the activity of the ventral part of the striatum was correlated with reward prediction at shorter time scales, and this correlated activity was stronger at low serotonin levels. By contrast, the activity of the dorsal part of the striatum was correlated with reward prediction at longer time scales, and this correlated activity was stronger at high serotonin levels. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that serotonin controls the time scale of reward prediction by differentially regulating activities within the striatum.},

Within the assumptions of the General Linear Model, we explore the tolerance of regression analyses of fMRI data to errors in the timing of the model relative to the experimental data under a number of circumstances. Given the sensitivity of the analysis to temporal shifts of the model relative to the data, one can search for the time a neuronal event occurs with temporal resolution on the order of a few hundred milliseconds with 95% confidence. This confidence level is strongly dependent on the signal-to-noise ratio of the observed BOLD responses (approximately +/-200 ms in our example of visual stimulation data collected at 1.5 T).},

title = {From fear to safety and back: reversal of fear in the human brain},
abstract = {Fear learning is a rapid and persistent process that promotes defense against threats and reduces the need to relearn about danger. However, it is also important to flexibly readjust fear behavior when circumstances change. Indeed, a failure to adjust to changing conditions may contribute to anxiety disorders. A central, yet neglected aspect of fear modulation is the ability to flexibly shift fear responses from one stimulus to another if a once-threatening stimulus becomes safe or a once-safe stimulus becomes threatening. In these situations, the inhibition of fear and the development of fear reactions co-occur but are directed at different targets, requiring accurate responding under continuous stress. To date, research on fear modulation has focused mainly on the shift from fear to safety by using paradigms such as extinction, resulting in a reduction of fear. The aim of the present study was to track the dynamic shifts from fear to safety and from safety to fear when these transitions occur simultaneously. We used functional neuroimaging in conjunction with a fear-conditioning reversal paradigm. Our results reveal a unique dissociation within the ventromedial prefrontal cortex between a safe stimulus that previously predicted danger and a "naive" safe stimulus. We show that amygdala and striatal responses tracked the fear-predictive stimuli, flexibly flipping their responses from one predictive stimulus to another. Moreover, prediction errors associated with reversal learning correlated with striatal activation. These results elucidate how fear is readjusted to appropriately track environmental changes, and the brain mechanisms underlying the flexible control of fear.},

abstract = {The anterior medial prefrontal cortex (AMPC) in humans is involved in affect and in regulating goal-directed behaviors. The precise function of the AMPC, however, is poorly understood. Using magnetic resonance imaging, we found that bilateral regions in the AMPC were selectively recruited to compute the reliability of subjects' expectations that developed when subjects were learning sequences of cognitive tasks. In contrast, regions similarly recruited in learning sequences of motor acts were found in the ventral striatum. Our results show that beyond the execution of motor acts, the AMPC is selectively engaged in computing the relevance of cognitive goals that subjects intend to achieve. This indicates that the fronto-striatal circuit, including the ventral striatum and AMPC, subserves hierarchically distinct evaluative processes mediating the human ability to build behavioral plans, ranging from motor to cognitive action plans.},

title = {Is dopamine required for natural reward?},
abstract = {Reward is fundamental to the organization of behavior, and the neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) is widely recognized to be critical to the neurobiology of reward, learning and addiction. Virtually all drugs of abuse, including heroin and other opiates, alcohol, cocaine, amphetamine and nicotine activate dopaminergic systems. So called "natural" rewards such as food, positive social interactions and even humor, likewise activate DA neurons and are powerful aids to attention and learning. Sweet solutions are a well-characterized natural reward. When a source of sugar is encountered, animals will consume substantial amounts, return to it preferentially, and will work to obtain access. Dopamine systems are activated in animals drinking sugar solutions, and lesions of dopaminergic neurons or pharmacological blockade of DA receptors seem to reduce the reward value of both sweet tastes and drugs of abuse. However, we have recently demonstrated that genetically modified mice that cannot make DA (DD mice) manifest normal sucrose preference. During preference tests, mutant mice initiated licking less frequently than did normal mice, but the rate of licking by DD mice for sweets was actually higher than that of normal mice, indicating that their motor ability to lick is intact. We conclude that DA is not required for the hedonic response to sweets nor for their discrimination. This brief and slightly humorous review discusses these findings in the context of current and historical answers to the question, "What is the role of DA in reward?"},

title = {Single-trial variability in event-related BOLD signals},
abstract = {Most current analysis methods for fMRI data assume a priori knowledge of the time course of the hemodynamic response (HR) to experimental stimuli or events in brain areas of interest. In addition, they typically assume homogeneity of both the HR and the non-HR "noise" signals, both across brain regions and across similar experimental events. When HRs vary unpredictably, from area to area or from trial to trial, an alternative approach is needed. Here, we use Infomax independent component analysis (ICA) to detect and visualize variations in single-trial HRs in event-related fMRI data. Six subjects participated in four fMRI sessions each in which ten bursts of 8-Hz flickering-checkerboard stimulation were presented for 0.5-s (short) or 3-s (long) durations at 30-s intervals. Five axial slices were acquired by a Bruker 3-T magnetic resonance imager at interscan intervals of 500 ms (TR). ICA decomposition of the resulting blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) data from each session produced an independent component active in primary visual cortex (V1) and, in several sessions, another active in medial temporal cortex (MT/V5). Visualizing sets of BOLD response epochs with novel BOLD-image plots demonstrated that component HRs varied substantially and often systematically across trials as well as across sessions, subjects, and brain areas. Contrary to expectation, in four of the six subjects the V1 component HR contained two positive peaks in response to short-stimulus bursts, while components with nearly identical regions of activity in long-stimulus sessions from the same subjects were associated with single-peaked HRs. Thus, ICA combined with BOLD-image visualization can reveal dramatic and unforeseen HR variations not apparent to researchers analyzing their data with event-related response averaging and fixed HR templates.},

title = {Dopaminergic drug effects on physiological connectivity in a human cortico-striato-thalamic system},
abstract = {Cortico-striato-thalamic (CST) systems are anatomical substrates for many motor and executive functions and are implicated in diverse neuropsychiatric disorders. Electrophysiological studies in rats, monkeys and patients with Parkinson's disease have shown that power and coherence of low frequency oscillations in CST systems can be profoundly modulated by dopaminergic drugs. We combined functional MRI with correlational and path analyses to investigate functional and effective connectivity, respectively, of a prefronto-striato-thalamic system activated by object location learning in healthy elderly human subjects (n = 23; mean age = 72 years). Participants were scanned in a repeated measures, randomized, placebo-controlled design to measure modulation of physiological connectivity between CST regions following treatment with drugs which served both to decrease (sulpiride) and increase (methylphenidate) dopaminergic transmission, as well as non-dopaminergic treatments (diazepam and scopolamine) to examine non-specific effects. Functional connectivity of caudate nucleus was modulated specifically by dopaminergic drugs, with opposing effects of sulpiride and methylphenidate. The more salient effect of sulpiride was to increase functional connectivity between caudate and both thalamus and ventral midbrain. A path diagram based on prior knowledge of unidirectional anatomical projections between CST components was fitted satisfactorily to the observed inter-regional covariance matrix. The effect of sulpiride was defined more specifically in the context of this model as increased strength of effective connection from ventral midbrain to caudate nucleus. In short, we have demonstrated enhanced functional and effective connectivity of human caudate nucleus following sulpiride treatment, which is compatible both with the anatomy of ascending dopaminergic projections and with electrophysiological studies indicating abnormal coherent oscillations of CST neurons in parkinsonian states.},

title = {Modulation of caudate activity by action contingency},
abstract = {Research has increasingly implicated the striatum in the processing of reward-related information in both animals and humans. However, it is unclear whether human striatal activation is driven solely by the hedonic properties of rewards or whether such activation is reliant on other factors, such as anticipation of upcoming reward or performance of an action to earn a reward. We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate hemodynamic responses to monetary rewards and punishments in three experiments that made use of an oddball paradigm. We presented reward and punishment displays randomly in time, following an anticipatory cue, or following a button press response. Robust and differential activation of the caudate nucleus occurred only when a perception of contingency existed between the button press response and the outcome. This finding suggests that the caudate is involved in reinforcement of action potentially leading to reward, rather than in processing reward per se.},

title = {Presynaptic Dopaminergic Deficits in Lesch-Nyhan Disease},
abstract = {Background Lesch-Nyhan disease is a rare, devastating, X-linked recessive disorder of purine synthesis. Patients present with hyperuricemia, choreoathetosis, dystonia, and aggressive and self-injurious behavior. Although the genetic and biochemical abnormalities have been identified, the causes of the neuropsychiatric syndrome remain unclear. Methods We used positron-emission tomography to measure presynaptic accumulation of fluorodopa F 18 tracer in the dopaminergic regions of the brains of 12 patients with Lesch-Nyhan disease (age, 10 to 20 years) and 15 healthy controls (age, 12 to 23). The results were expressed as ratios of specific to nonspecific radioactive counts. A low ratio indicates decreased dopa decarboxylase activity and dopamine storage. Results The fluorodopa F 18 ratio was significantly lower in the putamen (31 percent of control values), caudate nucleus (39 percent), frontal cortex (44 percent), and ventral tegmental complex (substantia nigra and ventral tegmentum; 57 percent) in the patients with Lesch-Nyhan disease than in the controls. Uptake of the tracer was abnormally low even in the youngest patients tested, and there was no overlap in the values between patients and controls. Conclusions Patients with Lesch-Nyhan disease have abnormally few dopaminergic nerve terminals and cell bodies. The abnormality involves all dopaminergic pathways and is not restricted to the basal ganglia. These dopaminergic deficits are pervasive and appear to be developmental in origin, which suggests that they contribute to the characteristic neuropsychiatric manifestations of the disease.},

title = {The influence of feedback valence in associative learning},
abstract = {The neural systems engaged by intrinsic positive or negative feedback were defined in an associative learning task. Through trial and error, participants learned the arbitrary assignments of a set of stimuli to one of two response categories. Informative feedback was provided on less than 25% of the trials. During positive feedback blocks, half of the trials were eligible for informative feedback; of these, informative feedback was only provided when the response was correct. A similar procedure was used on negative feedback blocks, but here informative feedback was only provided when the response was incorrect. In this manner, we sought to identify regions that were differentially responsive to positive and negative feedback as well as areas that were responsive to both types of informative feedback. Several regions of interest, including the bilateral nucleus accumbens, caudate nucleus, anterior insula, right cerebellar lobule VI, and left putamen, were sensitive to informative feedback regardless of valence. In contrast, several regions were more selective to positive feedback compared to negative feedback. These included the insula, amygdala, putamen, and supplementary motor area. No regions were more strongly activated by negative feedback compared to positive feedback. These results indicate that the neural areas supporting associative learning vary as a function of how that information is learned. In addition, areas linked to intrinsic reinforcement showed considerable overlap with those identified in studies using extrinsic reinforcers.},

title = {Neuronal activity in the monkey striatum during conditional visuomotor learning},
abstract = {The frontostriatal system has been implicated in linking sensory information and action through arbitrary rules. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of the striatum, a key, integrative structure in such behavior. We recorded single neuronal activity from the anterior striatum of two macaque monkeys as they learned to associate new visual cues with motor responses. Monkeys held a joystick which they could move in one of four constrained directions. During the recording sessions, they were presented with a set of well-learned associations (familiar condition), and with sets of new cues which they were required to map, by trial and error, with joystick movements (novel condition). A sample of 50 striatum neurons were studied during execution of familiar and novel conditions. Activity of most of them was strongly modulated during learning. These modulations were either transient or long lasting changes of neuronal firing rate. The findings suggest that the striatum is involved in early stages of conditional visuomotor learning, and are interpreted in relation with previous data on frontal cortex.},

abstract = {People experience relief whenever outcomes are better than they could have been, had an alternative course of action been chosen. Here we investigated the neuronal basis of relief with functional resonance imaging in a choice task in which the outcome of the chosen option and that of the unchosen option were revealed sequentially. We found parametric activation increases in anterior ventrolateral prefrontal cortex with increasing relief (chosen outcomes better than unchosen outcomes). Conversely, anterior ventrolateral prefrontal activation was unrelated to the opposite of relief, increasing regret (chosen outcomes worse than unchosen outcomes). Furthermore, the anterior ventrolateral prefrontal activation was unrelated to primary gains and increased with relief irrespective of whether the chosen outcome was a loss or a gain. These results suggest that the anterior ventrolateral prefrontal cortex encodes a higher-order reward signal that lies at the core of current theories of emotion.},

Thus, Gpr6 is the first striatopallidal neuron-specific genetic regulator of instrumental conditioning in a mammal.},

abstract = {Exploring how people represent natural categories is a key step toward developing a better understanding of how people learn, form memories, and make decisions. Much research on categorization has focused on artificial categories that are created in the laboratory, since studying natural categories defined on high-dimensional stimuli such as images is methodologically challenging. Recent work has produced methods for identifying these representations from observed behavior, such as reverse correlation (RC). We compare RC against an alternative method for inferring the structure of natural categories called Markov chain Monte Carlo with People (MCMCP). Based on an algorithm used in computer science and statistics, MCMCP provides a way to sample from the set of stimuli associated with a natural category. We apply MCMCP and RC to the problem of recovering natural categories that correspond to two kinds of facial affect (happy and sad) from realistic images of faces. Our results show that MCMCP requires fewer trials to obtain a higher quality estimate of people's mental representations of these two categories.},

According to recent reinforcement learning models, two distinct components are involved: a "critic," which learns to predict future reward, and an "actor," which maintains information about the rewarding outcomes of actions to enable better ones to be chosen more frequently. We scanned human participants with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they engaged in instrumental conditioning. Our results suggest partly dissociable contributions of the ventral and dorsal striatum, with the former corresponding to the critic and the latter corresponding to the actor.},

title = {Indices for testing neural codes},
abstract = {One of the most critical challenges in systems neuroscience is determining the neural code. A principled framework for addressing this can be found in information theory. With this approach, one can determine whether a proposed code can account for the stimulus-response relationship. Specifically, one can compare the transmitted information between the stimulus and the hypothesized neural code with the transmitted information between the stimulus and the behavioral response. If the former is smaller than the latter (i.e., if the code cannot account for the behavior), the code can be ruled out. The information-theoretic index most widely used in this context is Shannon's mutual information. The Shannon test, however, is not ideal for this purpose: while the codes it will rule out are truly nonviable, there will be some nonviable codes that it will fail to rule out. Here we describe a wide range of alternative indices that can be used for ruling codes out. The range includes a continuum from Shannon information to measures of the performance of a Bayesian decoder. We analyze the relationship of these indices to each other and their complementary strengths and weaknesses for addressing this problem.},

title = {Human striatal activation reflects degree of stimulus saliency},
abstract = {Salient stimuli are characterized by their capability to perturb and seize available cognitive resources. Although the striatum and its dopaminergic inputs respond to a variety of stimuli categorically defined as salient, including rewards, the relationship between striatal activity and saliency is not well understood. Specifically, it is unclear if the striatum responds in an all-or-none fashion to salient events or instead responds in a graded fashion to the degree of saliency associated with an event. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we measured activity in the brains of 20 participants performing a visual classification task in which they identified single digits as odd or even numbers. An auditory tone preceded each number, which was occasionally, and unexpectedly, substituted by a novel sound. The novel sounds varied in their ability to interrupt and reallocate cognitive resources (i.e., their saliency) as measured by a delay in reaction time to immediately subsequent numerical task-stimuli. The present findings demonstrate that striatal activity increases proportionally to the degree to which an unexpected novel sound interferes with the current cognitive focus, even in the absence of reward. These results suggest that activity in the human striatum reflects the level of saliency associated with a stimulus, perhaps providing a signal to reallocate limited resources to important events.},

It is determined by probability P, being maximal at P = 0.5 and decreasing at higher and lower probabilities. Using distinct stimuli to indicate the probability of reward, we found that the phasic activation of dopamine neurons varied monotonically across the full range of probabilities, supporting past claims that this response codes the discrepancy between predicted and actual reward. In contrast, a previously unobserved response covaried with uncertainty and consisted of a gradual increase in activity until the potential time of reward. The coding of uncertainty suggests a possible role for dopamine signals in attention-based learning and risk-taking behavior.},

title = {Rapid self-paced event-related functional MRI: feasibility and implications of stimulus- versus response-locked timing},
abstract = {Many cognitive paradigms require self-paced responses or examine events that occur at unpredictable times. To explore whether functional MRI (fMRI) can accommodate such paradigms, a method allowing rapid, unpredictable trial pacing was developed and tested on 17 subjects using activation of the motor network as a model. Trial onset was determined solely by the subjects' self-paced responses and trials occurred, on average, less than 2 s apart. The hemodynamic response was estimated both in relation to stimulus onset (stimulus-locked) and in relation to behavioral response time (response-locked). Results yielded robust activation maps and hemodynamic response estimates. Specifically, significant activation in motor cortex, supplementary motor area (SMA), and cerebellum was observed both at the group and at the individual-subject level, confirming predicted patterns of brain activity. Moreover, the self-paced design resulted in even temporal sampling of the hemodynamic response across the image acquisition, allowing estimation of response parameters. Stimulus-locked analysis demonstrated strong correlation between hemodynamic- and behavioral-response timing both within and across subjects. Conversely, response-locked analysis showed minimal correlation with behavioral timing, suggesting effective resynchronization of the timing parameters. These results demonstrate fMRI procedures that can accommodate rapid, arbitrarily timed events and, in doing so, provide precise temporal estimates of the hemodynamic response.},

title = {Making working memory work: a computational model of learning in the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia},
abstract = {The prefrontal cortex has long been thought to subserve both working memory (the holding of information online for processing) and executive functions (deciding how to manipulate working memory and perform processing). Although many computational models of working memory have been developed, the mechanistic basis of executive function remains elusive, often amounting to a homunculus. This article presents an attempt to deconstruct this homunculus through powerful learning mechanisms that allow a computational model of the prefrontal cortex to control both itself and other brain areas in a strategic, task-appropriate manner. These learning mechanisms are based on subcortical structures in the midbrain, basal ganglia, and amygdala, which together form an actor-critic architecture. The critic system learns which prefrontal representations are task relevant and trains the actor, which in turn provides a dynamic gating mechanism for controlling working memory updating. Computationally, the learning mechanism is designed to simultaneously solve the temporal and structural credit assignment problems. The model's performance compares favorably with standard backpropagation-based temporal learning mechanisms on the challenging 1-2-AX working memory task and other benchmark working memory tasks.},

abstract = {Understanding the effects of motivation on instrumental action selection, and specifically on its two main forms, goal-directed and habitual control, is fundamental to the study of decision making. Motivational states have been shown to 'direct' goal-directed behavior rather straightforwardly towards more valuable outcomes. However, how motivational states can influence outcome-insensitive habitual behavior is more mysterious. We adopt a normative perspective, assuming that animals seek to maximize the utilities they achieve, and viewing motivation as a mapping from outcomes to utilities. We suggest that habitual action selection can direct responding properly only in motivational states which pertained during behavioral training. However, in novel states, we propose that outcome-independent, global effects of the utilities can 'energize' habitual actions.},

title = {Temporal difference models and reward-related learning in the human brain},
abstract = {Temporal difference learning has been proposed as a model for Pavlovian conditioning, in which an animal learns to predict delivery of reward following presentation of a conditioned stimulus (CS). A key component of this model is a prediction error signal, which, before learning, responds at the time of presentation of reward but, after learning, shifts its response to the time of onset of the CS. In order to test for regions manifesting this signal profile, subjects were scanned using event-related fMRI while undergoing appetitive conditioning with a pleasant taste reward. Regression analyses revealed that responses in ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex were significantly correlated with this error signal, suggesting that, during appetitive conditioning, computations described by temporal difference learning are expressed in the human brain.},

title = {Action and outcome encoding in the primate caudate nucleus},
abstract = {The basal ganglia appear to have a central role in reinforcement learning. Previous experiments, focusing on activity preceding movement execution, support the idea that dorsal striatal neurons bias action selection according to the expected values of actions. However, many phasically active striatal neurons respond at a time too late to initiate or select movements. Given the data suggesting a role for the basal ganglia in reinforcement learning, postmovement activity may therefore reflect evaluative processing important for learning the values of actions. To better understand these postmovement neurons, we determined whether individual striatal neurons encode information about saccade direction, whether a reward had been received, or both. We recorded from phasically active neurons in the caudate nucleus while monkeys performed a probabilistically rewarded delayed saccade task. Many neurons exhibited peak responses after saccade execution (77 of 149) that were often tuned for the direction of the preceding saccade (61 of 77). Of those neurons responding during the reward epoch, one subset showed direction tuning for the immediately preceding saccade (43 of 60), whereas another subset responded differentially on rewarded versus unrewarded trials (35 of 60). We found that there was relatively little overlap of these properties in individual neurons. The encoding of action and outcome was performed by largely separate populations of caudate neurons that were active after movement execution. Thus, striatal neurons active primarily after a movement appear to be segregated into two distinct groups that provide complimentary information about the outcomes of actions.},

title = {Representation and timing in theories of the dopamine system},
abstract = {Although the responses of dopamine neurons in the primate midbrain are well characterized as carrying a temporal difference (TD) error signal for reward prediction, existing theories do not offer a credible account of how the brain keeps track of past sensory events that may be relevant to predicting future reward. Empirically, these shortcomings of previous theories are particularly evident in their account of experiments in which animals were exposed to variation in the timing of events. The original theories mispredicted the results of such experiments due to their use of a representational device called a tapped delay line. Here we propose that a richer understanding of history representation and a better account of these experiments can be given by considering TD algorithms for a formal setting that incorporates two features not originally considered in theories of the dopaminergic response: partial observability (a distinction between the animal's sensory experience and the true underlying state of the world) and semi-Markov dynamics (an explicit account of variation in the intervals between events). The new theory situates the dopaminergic system in a richer functional and anatomical context, since it assumes (in accord with recent computational theories of cortex) that problems of partial observability and stimulus history are solved in sensory cortex using statistical modeling and inference and that the TD system predicts reward using the results of this inference rather than raw sensory data. It also accounts for a range of experimental data, including the experiments involving programmed temporal variability and other previously unmodeled dopaminergic response phenomena, which we suggest are related to subjective noise in animals' interval timing. Finally, it offers new experimental predictions and a rich theoretical framework for designing future experiments.},

abstract = {Humans engaged in monotonous tasks are susceptible to occasional errors that may lead to serious consequences, but little is known about brain activity patterns preceding errors. Using functional MRI and applying independent component analysis followed by deconvolution of hemodynamic responses, we studied error preceding brain activity on a trial-by-trial basis. We found a set of brain regions in which the temporal evolution of activation predicted performance errors. These maladaptive brain activity changes started to evolve approximately 30 sec before the error. In particular, a coincident decrease of deactivation in default mode regions of the brain, together with a decline of activation in regions associated with maintaining task effort, raised the probability of future errors. Our findings provide insights into the brain network dynamics preceding human performance errors and suggest that monitoring of the identified precursor states may help in avoiding human errors in critical real-world situations.},

abstract = {Associative learning theory assumes that prediction error is a driving force in learning. A competing view, probabilistic contrast (PC) theory, is that learning and prediction error are unrelated. We tested a learning phenomenon that has proved troublesome for associative theory--retrospective revaluation--to evaluate these two models. We previously showed that activation in right lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) provides a reliable signature for the presence of prediction error. Thus, if the associative view is correct, retrospective revaluation should be accompanied by right lateral PFC activation. PC theory would be supported by the absence of this activation. Right PFC and ventral striatal activation occurred during retrospective revaluation, supporting the associative account. Activations appeared to reflect the degree of revaluation, predicting later brain responses to revalued cues. Our results support a modified associative account of retrospective revaluation and demonstrate the potential of functional neuroimaging as a tool for evaluating competing learning models.},

To elucidate the role of the basal ganglia in this process, we recorded striatal neurons of monkeys who chose between left and right handle turns, based on the estimated reward probabilities of the actions.

Fewer neurons were tuned to relative values or action choice. These results suggest representation of action values in the striatum, which can guide action selection in the basal ganglia circuit.},

title = {Probabilistic learning and reversal deficits in patients with Parkinson's disease or frontal or temporal lobe lesions: possible adverse effects of dopaminergic medication},
abstract = {Three groups of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) - mild, unmedicated (UPD), mild, medicated (MPD) and severe, medicated (SPD) - and patients with lesions of the frontal lobe (FLL) or temporal lobe (TLL) were compared with matched controls on the learning and reversal of probabilistic and two-pair concurrent colour discriminations. Both of the cortical lesion groups showed reversal deficits, with no increase in perseverative responding. The UPD group, although impaired on a spatial recognition task, showed intact discrimination learning and reversal; the MPD and SPD patients showed non-perseverative reversal impairments on both reversal tasks. Two hypotheses - based on disease severity and possible deleterious effects of medication - are offered to explain the reversal impairments of the PD patients and the results are discussed in terms of the role of dopamine in reward-based learning.},

title = {Experience-induced Changes of Dendritic Spine Densities in the Prefrontal and Sensory Cortex: Correlation with Developmental Time Windows},
abstract = {The present study provides evidence for the hypothesis that the extent and the direction of experience-induced synaptic changes in cortical areas correlates with time windows of neuronal as well as endocrine development. Repeated brief exposure to maternal separation prior to the stress hyporesponsive period (SHRP) of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis induced significantly reduced dendritic spine density (-16%) in layer II/III pyramidal neurons of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACd) of 21-day-old rats, whereas separation after termination of the SHRP resulted in increased spine densities (+16%) in this neuron type. In addition, rats of both groups displayed elevated basal plasma levels of corticosterone at this age. Separation during the SHRP (postnatal days 5-7) did not influence spine density in the ACd, and basal corticosterone levels remained unchanged. In contrast, pyramidal neurons in the somatosensory cortex (SSC) displayed significantly enhanced spine densities (up to 52% increase) independent from the time of separation. These results indicate that alterations in the synaptic balance in limbic and sensory cortical regions in response to early emotional experience are region-specific and related to the maturational stage of endocrine and neuronal systems.},

title = {Choice selection and reward anticipation: an fMRI study},
abstract = {We examined neural activations during decision-making using fMRI paired with the wheel of fortune task, a newly developed two-choice decision-making task with probabilistic monetary gains. In particular, we assessed the impact of high-reward/risk events relative to low-reward/risk events on neural activations during choice selection and during reward anticipation. Seventeen healthy adults completed the study. We found, in line with predictions, that (i) the selection phase predominantly recruited regions involved in visuo-spatial attention (occipito-parietal pathway), conflict (anterior cingulate), manipulation of quantities (parietal cortex), and preparation for action (premotor area), whereas the anticipation phase prominently recruited regions engaged in reward processes (ventral striatum); and (ii) high-reward/risk conditions relative to low-reward/risk conditions were associated with a greater neural response in ventral striatum during selection, though not during anticipation. Following an a priori ROI analysis focused on orbitofrontal cortex, we observed orbitofrontal cortex activation (BA 11 and 47) during selection (particularly to high-risk/reward options), and to a more limited degree, during anticipation. These findings support the notion that (1) distinct, although overlapping, pathways subserve the processes of selection and anticipation in a two-choice task of probabilistic monetary reward; (2) taking a risk and awaiting the consequence of a risky decision seem to affect neural activity differently in selection and anticipation; and thus (3) common structures, including the ventral striatum, are modulated differently by risk/reward during selection and anticipation.},

title = {Reward-guided learning beyond dopamine in the nucleus accumbens: the integrative functions of cortico-basal ganglia networks},
abstract = {Here we challenge the view that reward-guided learning is solely controlled by the mesoaccumbens pathway arising from dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area and projecting to the nucleus accumbens. This widely accepted view assumes that reward is a monolithic concept, but recent work has suggested otherwise. It now appears that, in reward-guided learning, the functions of ventral and dorsal striata, and the cortico-basal ganglia circuitry associated with them, can be dissociated. Whereas the nucleus accumbens is necessary for the acquisition and expression of certain appetitive Pavlovian responses and contributes to the motivational control of instrumental performance, the dorsal striatum is necessary for the acquisition and expression of instrumental actions. Such findings suggest the existence of multiple independent yet interacting functional systems that are implemented in iterating and hierarchically organized cortico-basal ganglia networks engaged in appetitive behaviors ranging from Pavlovian approach responses to goal-directed instrumental actions controlled by action-outcome contingencies.},

title = {Small-World Brain Networks},
abstract = {Many complex networks have a small-world topology characterized by dense local clustering or cliquishness of connections between neighboring nodes yet a short path length between any (distant) pair of nodes due to the existence of relatively few long-range connections. This is an attractive model for the organization of brain anatomical and functional networks because a small-world topology can support both segregated/specialized and distributed/integrated information processing. Moreover, small-world networks are economical, tending to minimize wiring costs while supporting high dynamical complexity. The authors introduce some of the key mathematical concepts in graph theory required for small-world analysis and review how these methods have been applied to quantification of cortical connectivity matrices derived from anatomical tract-tracing studies in the macaque monkey and the cat. The evolution of small-world networks is discussed in terms of a selection pressure to deliver cost-effective information-processing systems. The authors illustrate how these techniques and concepts are increasingly being applied to the analysis of human brain functional networks derived from electroencephalography/magnetoencephalography and fMRI experiments. Finally, the authors consider the relevance of small-world models for understanding the emergence of complex behaviors and the resilience of brain systems to pathological attack by disease or aberrant development. They conclude that small-world models provide a powerful and versatile approach to understanding the structure and function of human brain systems.},

title = {Neuronal activity in monkey ventral striatum related to the expectation of reward},
abstract = {Projections from cortical and subcortical limbic structures to the basal ganglia are predominantly directed to the ventral striatum. The present study investigated how the expectation of external events with behavioral significance is reflected in the activity of ventral striatal neurons. A total of 420 neurons were studied in macaque monkeys performing in a delayed go-no-go task. Lights of different colors instructed the animal to do an arm-reaching movement or refrain from moving, respectively, when a trigger light was illuminated a few seconds later. Task performance was reinforced by liquid reward in both situations. A total of 60 ventral striatal neurons showed sustained increases of activity before the occurrence of individual task events. In 43 of these neurons, activations specifically preceded the delivery of reward, independent of the movement or no-movement reaction. In a series of additional tests, these activations were time locked to the subsequent reward, disappeared within a few trials when reward was omitted, and were temporally unrelated to mouth movements. Changes in the appetitive value of the reward liquid modified the magnitude of activations, suggesting a possible relationship to the hedonic properties of the expected event. Activations also occurred when reward was delivered in a predictable manner outside of any behavioral task. These data suggest that neurons in the ventral striatum are activated during states of expectation of individual environmental events that are predictable to the subject through its past experience. The prevalence of activations related to the expectation of reward suggests that ventral striatal neurons have access to central representations of reward and thereby participate in the processing of information underlying the motivational control of goal-directed behavior.},

title = {Differential encoding of information about progress through multi-trial reward schedules by three groups of ventral striatal neurons},
abstract = {In the course of daily activity we continually judge whether the goal sought is worth the work that must be done to obtain it. The ventral striatum is thought to play a central role in making such judgments. When reward schedules are used to investigate these judgments ventral striatum neurons show responses near the time of the cue, the bar-release, and/or the reward delivery. We evaluated the type of coding that occurs at these three time points by using codes or factorizations with: (1) two states for reward versus non-reward, (2) four states for the progress in the reward schedule, and (3) six states for all of the states of the schedule, quantified using information theory and ANOVA. For the bar-release- and reward-related responses the percent variance explained was as high for the two states code as with the six states code. The information for the four state code rose slightly but significantly for the bar-release-related neurons. For the cue-related neurons the code with six states carried more information than the simpler codes. Thus, responses at different times appear to play different roles. Responses occurring early in trials differentiate all states, i.e., the path to a reward, whereas those late in trials code knowledge of impending reward.},

In this study, discrete categories of beautiful faces are shown to have differing reward values and to differentially activate reward circuitry in human subjects. In particular, young heterosexual males rate pictures of beautiful males and females as attractive, but exert effort via a keypress procedure only to view pictures of attractive females. Functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T shows that passive viewing of beautiful female faces activates reward circuitry, in particular the nucleus accumbens. An extended set of subcortical and paralimbic reward regions also appear to follow aspects of the keypress rather than the rating procedures, suggesting that reward circuitry function does not include aesthetic assessment.},

title = {The role of emotion in decision-making: evidence from neurological patients with orbitofrontal damage},
abstract = {Most theories of choice assume that decisions derive from an assessment of the future outcomes of various options and alternatives through some type of cost-benefit analyses. The influence of emotions on decision-making is largely ignored. The studies of decision-making in neurological patients who can no longer process emotional information normally suggest that people make judgments not only by evaluating the consequences and their probability of occurring, but also and even sometimes primarily at a gut or emotional level. Lesions of the ventromedial (which includes the orbitofrontal) sector of the prefrontal cortex interfere with the normal processing of "somatic" or emotional signals, while sparing most basic cognitive functions. Such damage leads to impairments in the decision-making process, which seriously compromise the quality of decisions in daily life. The aim of this paper is to review evidence in support of "The Somatic Marker Hypothesis," which provides a systems-level neuroanatomical and cognitive framework for decision-making and suggests that the process of decision-making depends in many important ways on neural substrates that regulate homeostasis, emotion, and feeling. The implications of this theoretical framework for the normal and abnormal development of the orbitofrontal cortex are also discussed.},

title = {A mechanistic account of striatal dopamine function in human cognition: psychopharmacological studies with cabergoline and haloperidol},
abstract = {The authors test a neurocomputational model of dopamine function in cognition by administering to healthy participants low doses of D-sub-2 agents cabergoline and haloperidol. The model suggests that DA dynamically modulates the balance of Go and No-Go basal ganglia pathways during cognitive learning and performance. Cabergoline impaired, while haloperidol enhanced, Go learning from positive reinforcement, consistent with presynaptic drug effects. Cabergoline also caused an overall bias toward Go responding, consistent with postsynaptic action. These same effects extended to working memory and attentional domains, supporting the idea that the basal ganglia/dopamine system modulates the updating of prefrontal representations. Drug effects interacted with baseline working memory span in all tasks. Taken together, the results support a unified account of the role of dopamine in modulating cognitive processes that depend on the basal ganglia. ((c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved).},

title = {How do people solve the "weather prediction" task?: individual variability in strategies for probabilistic category learning},
abstract = {Probabilistic category learning is often assumed to be an incrementally learned cognitive skill, dependent on nondeclarative memory systems. One paradigm in particular, the weather prediction task, has been used in over half a dozen neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies to date. Because of the growing interest in using this task and others like it as behavioral tools for studying the cognitive neuroscience of cognitive skill learning, it becomes especially important to understand how subjects solve this kind of task and whether all subjects learn it in the same way. We present here new experimental and theoretical analyses of the weather prediction task that indicate that there are at least three different strategies that describe how subjects learn this task. (1) An optimal multi-cue strategy, in which they respond to each pattern on the basis of associations of all four cues with each outcome; (2) a one-cue strategy, in which they respond on the basis of presence or absence of a single cue, disregarding all other cues; or (3) a singleton strategy, in which they learn only about the four patterns that have only one cue present and all others absent. This variability in how subjects approach this task may have important implications for interpreting how different brain regions are involved in probabilistic category learning.},

title = {Tonically active neurons in the striatum encode motivational contexts of action},
abstract = {In order to achieve a goal, one procures immediately available rewards, escape from aversive events or endures absence of rewards. The neuronal substrate for these goal-directed actions includes the limbic system and the basal ganglia. In the basal ganglia, classes of projection neurons in the striatum show activity with motivational as well as sensorimotor properties, such as expectation of reward and task schedule for obtaining reward. Tonically active neurons (TANs), presumed cholinergic interneurons in the striatum, respond to reward-associated stimuli, evolve their activity through learning and respond also to aversive event-associated stimuli such as airpuff on the face. A recent study showed that responses to visual cues are less selective to whether the cue instructs reward or no reward. To address this paradox, we asked macaque monkeys to perform a set of visual reaction time tasks while expecting the reward, aversive event or absence of reward. We found that TANs respond to instruction stimuli associated with motivational outcomes but not to unassociated ones, and that they mostly differentiate associated instructions. We also found that the higher percentage of TANs in the caudate nucleus respond to stimuli associated with motivational outcomes than in the putamen, whereas the higher percentage of TANs in the putamen respond to GO signals than in the caudate nucleus especially for an action anticipating a reward. These findings suggest a distinct, pivotal role played by TANs in the caudate nucleus and putamen in encoding instructed motivational contexts for goal-directed action selection and learning in the striatum.},

abstract = {The time histogram method is the most basic tool for capturing a time dependent rate of neuronal spikes. Generally in the neurophysiological literature, the bin size that critically determines the goodness of the fit of the time histogram to the underlying spike rate has been subjectively selected by individual researchers. Here, we propose a method for objectively selecting the bin size from the spike count statistics alone, so that the resulting bar or line graph time histogram best represents the unknown underlying spike rate. For a small number of spike sequences generated from a modestly fluctuating rate, the optimal bin size may diverge, indicating that any time histogram is likely to capture a spurious rate. Given a paucity of data, the method presented here can nevertheless suggest how many experimental trials should be added in order to obtain a meaningful time-dependent histogram with the required accuracy.},

title = {Change point estimation in multi-subject fMRI studies},
abstract = {Most statistical analyses of fMRI data assume that the nature, timing and duration of the psychological processes being studied are known. However, in many areas of psychological inquiry, it is hard to specify this information a priori. Examples include studies of drug uptake, emotional states or experiments with a sustained stimulus. In this paper we assume that the timing of a subject's activation onset and duration are random variables drawn from unknown population distributions. We propose a technique for estimating these distributions assuming no functional form, and allowing for the possibility that some subjects may show no response. We illustrate how these distributions can be used to approximate the probability that a voxel/region is activated as a function of time. Further a procedure is discussed that uses a hidden Markov random field model to cluster voxels based on characteristics of their onset, duration, and anatomical location. These methods are applied to an fMRI study (n=24) of state anxiety, and are well suited for investigating individual differences in state-related changes in fMRI activity and other measures.},

title = {The neural correlates of motor skill automaticity},
abstract = {Acquisition of a new skill is generally associated with a decrease in the need for effortful control over performance, leading to the development of automaticity. Automaticity by definition has been achieved when performance of a primary task is minimally affected by other ongoing tasks. The neural basis of automaticity was examined by testing subjects in a serial reaction time (SRT) task under both single-task and dual-task conditions. The diminishing cost of dual-task performance was used as an index for automaticity. Subjects performed the SRT task during two functional magnetic imaging sessions separated by 3 h of behavioral training over multiple days. Behavioral data showed that, by the end of testing, subjects had automated performance of the SRT task. Before behavioral training, performance of the SRT task concurrently with the secondary task elicited activation in a wide network of frontal and striatal regions, as well as parietal lobe. After extensive behavioral training, dual-task performance showed comparatively less activity in bilateral ventral premotor regions, right middle frontal gyrus, and right caudate body; activity in other prefrontal and striatal regions decreased equally for single-task and dual-task conditions. These data suggest that lateral and dorsolateral prefrontal regions, and their corresponding striatal targets, subserve the executive processes involved in novice dual-task performance. The results also showed that supplementary motor area and putamen/globus pallidus regions showed training-related decreases for sequence conditions but not for random conditions, confirming the role of these regions in the representation of learned motor sequences.},

title = {Construction of a 3D probabilistic atlas of human cortical structures},
abstract = {We describe the construction of a digital brain atlas composed of data from manually delineated MRI data. A total of 56 structures were labeled in MRI of 40 healthy, normal volunteers. This labeling was performed according to a set of protocols developed for this project. Pairs of raters were assigned to each structure and trained on the protocol for that structure. Each rater pair was tested for concordance on 6 of the 40 brains; once they had achieved reliability standards, they divided the task of delineating the remaining 34 brains. The data were then spatially normalized to well-known templates using 3 popular algorithms: AIR5.2.5's nonlinear warp (Woods et al., 1998) paired with the ICBM452 Warp 5 atlas (Rex et al., 2003), FSL's FLIRT (Smith et al., 2004) was paired with its own template, a skull-stripped version of the ICBM152 T1 average; and SPM5's unified segmentation method (Ashburner and Friston, 2005) was paired with its canonical brain, the whole head ICBM152 T1 average. We thus produced 3 variants of our atlas, where each was constructed from 40 representative samples of a data processing stream that one might use for analysis. For each normalization algorithm, the individual structure delineations were then resampled according to the computed transformations. We next computed averages at each voxel location to estimate the probability of that voxel belonging to each of the 56 structures. Each version of the atlas contains, for every voxel, probability densities for each region, thus providing a resource for automated probabilistic labeling of external data types registered into standard spaces; we also computed average intensity images and tissue density maps based on the three methods and target spaces. These atlases will serve as a resource for diverse applications including meta-analysis of functional and structural imaging data and other bioinformatics applications where display of arbitrary labels in probabilistically defined anatomic space will facilitate both knowledge-based development and visualization of findings from multiple disciplines.},

abstract = {The desire to seek new and unfamiliar experiences is a fundamental behavioral tendency in humans and other species. In economic decision making, novelty seeking is often rational, insofar as uncertain options may prove valuable and advantageous in the long run. Here, we show that, even when the degree of perceptual familiarity of an option is unrelated to choice outcome, novelty nevertheless drives choice behavior. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we show that this behavior is specifically associated with striatal activity, in a manner consistent with computational accounts of decision making under uncertainty. Furthermore, this activity predicts interindividual differences in susceptibility to novelty. These data indicate that the brain uses perceptual novelty to approximate choice uncertainty in decision making, which in certain contexts gives rise to a newly identified and quantifiable source of human irrationality.},

title = {Position and behavioral modulation of synchronization of hippocampal and accumbens neuronal discharges in freely moving rats},
abstract = {To understand how hippocampal signals are processed by downstream neurons, we analyzed the relative timing between neuronal discharges in simultaneous recordings in the hippocampus and nucleus accumbens of rats performing in a plus maze. In all, 154 pairs of cells (composed of 65 hippocampal and 56 accumbens neurons) were examined during the 1 s period prior to reward delivery. Cross-correlation analyses over a +/- 300-ms window with 10-ms bins revealed that 108 pairs had at least one significant histogram bin (P < 0.01). The most frequently occurring peaks of hippocampal firing prior to accumbens discharges appeared at latencies from -30-0 ms, corresponding to published values of the latency of the hippocampal pathway to the nucleus accumbens. Other peaks appeared most often at latencies multiples of about 110 ms prior to and after this, corresponding to theta rhythmicity. Since firing synchronization can result from several types of connectivity patterns (such as common inputs), a group of 18 hippocampus-accumbens pairs was selected as those most likely to have monosynaptic connections. The criterion was the presence of at least one highly significant peak (P < 0.001) at latencies corresponding to field potentials evoked in the accumbens by hippocampal stimulation. A significant peak occurred on all four maze arms for only one of these cell pairs, indicating positional modulation for the others. In addition, behavior dependence of the synchrony between these nucleus accumbens and hippocampus neurons was examined by studying data in relation to three different synchronization points: reward box arrival, box departure, and arrival at the center of the maze. This indicates that the functional connectivity between hippocampal and accumbens neurons was stronger when the rat was near reward areas. Ten of the hippocampal neurons in these 18 cell pairs showed 9-Hz (theta) rhythmic activity in autocorrelation analyses. Of these 10 cells, cross-correlograms from eight hippocampal-accumbens pairs also showed theta rhythmicity. Overall, these results indicate that the synchrony between hippocampus and nucleus accumbens neurons is modulated by spatial position and behavior, and theta rhythm may play an important role for this synchronization.},

abstract = {Changes in regional blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals in response to brief visual stimuli can exhibit a variety of time-courses. To demonstrate the anatomical distribution of BOLD response shapes during a match to sample task, a formal analysis of their time-courses is presented. An event-related design was used to estimate regional BOLD responses evoked by a cue word, which instructed the subject to attend to the motion or color of an upcoming target, and those evoked by a briefly presented moving target consisting of colored dots. Regional BOLD time-courses were adequately represented by the linear combination of three orthogonal waveforms. BOLD response shapes were then classified using a fuzzy clustering scheme. Three classes (sustained, phasic, and negative) best characterized cue responses. Four classes (sustained, sustained-phasic, phasic, and bi-phasic) best characterized target responses. In certain regions, the shape of the BOLD responses was modulated by the instruction to attend to the target's motion or color. A left frontal and a posterior parietal region showed sustained activity when motion was cued and transient activity when color was cued. A right thalamic and a left lateral occipital region showed sustained activity when color was cued and transient activity when motion was cued. Following the target several regions showed more sustained activity during motion than color trials. In summary, the effect of the task variable was focal following the cue and widespread following the target. We conclude that the temporal patterns of neural activity affected the shape of the BOLD signal.},

abstract = {Primates have the remarkable ability to rapidly adjust or modify associations between visual cues and specific motor responses. Whereas little is known as to how such adjustments in behavioral policy are implemented, recent learning models suggest that the anterior striatum is optimally positioned to have a role in this process. We recorded from single units and delivered microstimulation in the striatum of rhesus monkeys performing an associative learning task. Caudate activity during reinforcement was closely correlated with the rate of learning and peaked during the steepest portion of the learning curve when new associations were being acquired. Moreover, delivering microstimulation in the caudate during the reinforcement period significantly increased the rate of learning without altering the monkeys' ultimate performance. These findings suggest that the caudate is responsible for implementing selective adjustments to the 'associative weights' between sensory cues and motor responses during learning, thus enhancing the likelihood of selecting profitable actions.},

abstract = {In this study we examined the effect of dopaminergic modulation on learning and memory. Parkinson's patients were tested 'on' versus 'off' dopaminergic medication, using a two-phase learning and transfer task. We found that dopaminergic medication was associated with impaired learning of an incrementally acquired concurrent discrimination task, while patients withdrawn from dopaminergic medication performed as well as controls. In addition, we found a dissociation of the effect of medication within a single two-phase task: patients tested 'on' medication were not impaired at the ability to generalize based on learned information. The deficit among medicated patients appeared to be related specifically to the concurrent, incremental, feedback-based nature of the task: such a deficit was not found in a version of the task in which demands for concurrent error-processing learning were reduced. Taken together with a growing body of evidence emphasizing a role for midbrain dopamine in error-correcting, feedback-based learning processes, the present results suggest a framework for understanding previously conflicting results regarding the effect of medication on learning and memory in Parkinson's disease.},

title = {Cue-evoked firing of nucleus accumbens neurons encodes motivational significance during a discriminative stimulus task},
abstract = {The nucleus accumbens (NAc) has long been thought of as a limbic-motor interface. Despite behavioral and anatomical evidence in favor of this idea, little is known about how NAc neurons encode information about motivationally relevant environmental cues and use this information to affect motor action. We therefore investigated the firing of these neurons during the performance of a discriminative stimulus (DS) task using simultaneous multiple single-unit recordings in rats. In this task, two stimuli are randomly presented to the animal: a DS, which signals the availability of a sucrose reward contingent on an operant response, and a similar but nonrewarded stimulus (NS). Subpopulations of NAc neurons increased or decreased their firing in association with several distinct components of the task. In this paper, we investigate cue- and operant-responsive neurons. Neurons excited and inhibited by cues showed larger firing changes in response to the DS than the NS and larger changes when the animal made an operant response to the cue than when the animal failed to respond. Excitations during operant responding were not modulated by the information contained by the cue, whereas inhibitions during operant responding were somewhat larger if the operant response occurred during the DS and somewhat smaller if they occurred in the absence of a cue. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the firing of subpopulations of NAc neurons encode both the predictive value of environmental stimuli and the specific motor behaviors required to respond to them.},

abstract = {The past two decades have seen an enormous growth in the field of human brain mapping. Investigators have extensively exploited techniques such as positron emission tomography and MRI to map patterns of brain activity based on changes in cerebral hemodynamics. However, until recently, most studies have investigated equilibrium changes in blood flow measured over time periods upward of 1 min. The advent of high-speed MRI methods, capable of imaging the entire brain with a temporal resolution of a few seconds, allows for brain mapping based on more transient aspects of the hemodynamic response. Today it is now possible to map changes in cerebrovascular parameters essentially in real time, conferring the ability to observe changes in brain state that occur over time periods of seconds. Furthermore, because robust hemodynamic alterations are detectable after neuronal stimuli lasting only a few tens of milliseconds, a new class of task paradigms designed to measure regional responses to single sensory or cognitive events can now be studied. Such "event related" functional MRI should provide for fundamentally new ways to interrogate brain function, and allow for the direct comparison and ultimately integration of data acquired by using more traditional behavioral and electrophysiological methods.},

Here, we draw on recent work on computational models of dopaminergic function to suggest a framework by which many of the seemingly diverse functions associated with both DA and serotonin-comprising both affective and activational ones, as well as a number of other functions not overtly related to either-can be seen as consequences of a single root mechanism.},

abstract = {We mapped ocular dominance columns (ODCs) in normal human subjects using high-field (4 T) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with a segmented echo planar imaging technique and an in-plane resolution of 0.47 x 0.47 mm(2). The differential responses to left or right eye stimulation could be reliably resolved in anatomically well-defined sections of V1. The orientation and width ( approximately 1 mm) of mapped ODC stripes conformed to those previously revealed in postmortem brains stained with cytochrome oxidase. In addition, we showed that mapped ODC patterns could be largely reproduced in different experiments conducted within the same experimental session or over different sessions. Our results demonstrate that high-field fMRI can be used for studying the functions of human brains at columnar spatial resolution.},

abstract = {Probabilistic category learning engages neural circuitry that includes the prefrontal cortex and caudate nucleus, two regions that show prominent changes with normal aging. However, the specific contributions of these brain regions are uncertain, and the effects of normal aging have not been examined previously in probabilistic category learning. In the present study, using a blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging block design, 18 healthy young adults (mean age, 25.5 \+/-\ 2.6 years) and 15 older adults (mean age, 67.1 \+/-\ 5.3 years) were assessed on the probabilistic category learning "weather prediction" test. Whole-brain functional images acquired using a 1.5T scanner (General Electric, Milwaukee, WI) with gradient echo, echo planar imaging (3/1 mm; repetition time, 3000 ms; echo time, 50 ms) were analyzed using second-level random-effects procedures {\$}[{\$}SPM99 (Statistical Parametric Mapping){\$}]{\$}. Young and older adults displayed equivalent probabilistic category learning curves, used similar strategies, and activated analogous neural networks, including the prefrontal and parietal cortices and the caudate nucleus. However, the extent of caudate and prefrontal activation was less and parietal activation was greater in older participants. The percentage correct and reaction time were mainly positively correlated with caudate and prefrontal activation in young individuals but positively correlated with prefrontal and parietal cortices in older individuals. Differential activation within a circumscribed neural network in the context of equivalent learning suggests that some brain regions, such as the parietal cortices, may provide a compensatory mechanism for healthy older adults in the context of deficient prefrontal cortex and caudate nuclei responses.},

title = {Mapping Pavlovian conditioning effects on the brain: blocking, contiguity, and excitatory effects},
abstract = {Pavlovian conditioning effects on the brain were investigated by mapping rat brain activity with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) autoradiography. The goal was to map the effects of the same tone after blocking or eliciting a conditioned emotional response (CER). In the tone-blocked group, previous learning about a light blocked a CER to the tone. In the tone-excitor group, the same pairings of tone with shock US resulted in a CER to the tone in the absence of previous learning about the light. A third group showed no CER after pseudorandom presentations of these stimuli. Brain systems involved in the various associative effects of Pavlovian conditioning were identified, and their functional significance was interpreted in light of previous FDG studies. Three conditioning effects were mapped: 1) blocking effects: FDG uptake was lower in medial prefrontal cortex and higher in spinal trigeminal and cuneate nuclei in the tone-blocked group relative to the tone-excitor group. 2) Contiguity effects: relative to pseudorandom controls, similar FDG uptake increases in the tone-blocked and -excitor groups were found in auditory regions (inferior colliculus and cortex), hippocampus (CA1), cerebellum, caudate putamen, and solitary nucleus. Contiguity effects may be due to tone-shock pairings common to the tone-blocked and -excitor groups rather than their different CER. And 3) excitatory effects: FDG uptake increases limited to the tone-excitor group occurred in a circuit linked to the CER, including insular and anterior cingulate cortex, vertical diagonal band nucleus, anterior hypothalamus, and caudoventral caudate putamen. This study provided the first large-scale map of brain regions underlying the Kamin blocking effect on conditioning. In particular, the results suggest that suppression of prefrontal activity and activation of unconditioned stimulus pathways are important neural substrates of the Kamin blocking effect.},

abstract = {The ability to remember a briefly presented scene depends on a number of factors, such as its saliency, novelty, degree of threat, or behavioral relevance to a task. Here, however, we show that the encoding of a scene into memory may depend not only on what the scene contains but also when it occurs. Participants performed an attentionally demanding target detection task at fixation while also viewing a rapid sequence of full-field photographs of urban and natural scenes. Participants were then tested on whether they recognized a specific scene from the previous sequence. We found that scenes were recognized reliably only when presented concurrently with a target at fixation. This is evidence of a mechanism where traces of a visual scene are automatically encoded into memory at behaviorally relevant points in time regardless of the spatial focus of attention.},

title = {Automated brainstem co-registration (ABC) for MRI},
abstract = {Group data analysis in brainstem neuroimaging is predicated on accurate co-registration of anatomy. As the brainstem is comprised of many functionally heterogeneous nuclei densely situated adjacent to one another, relatively small errors in co-registration can manifest in increased variance or decreased sensitivity (or significance) in detecting activations. We have devised a 2-stage automated, reference mask guided registration technique (Automated Brainstem Co-registration, or ABC) for improved brainstem co-registration. Our approach utilized a brainstem mask dataset to weight an automated co-registration cost function. Our method was validated through measurement of RMS error at 12 manually defined landmarks. These landmarks were also used as guides for a secondary manual co-registration option, intended for outlier individuals that may not adequately co-register with our automated method. Our methodology was tested on 10 healthy human subjects and compared to traditional co-registration techniques (Talairach transform and automated affine transform to the MNI-152 template). We found that ABC had a significantly lower mean RMS error (1.22 +/- 0.39 mm) than Talairach transform (2.88 +/- 1.22 mm, mu +/- sigma) and the global affine (3.26 +/- 0.81 mm) method. Improved accuracy was also found for our manual-landmark-guided option (1.51 +/- 0.43 mm). Visualizing individual brainstem borders demonstrated more consistent and uniform overlap for ABC compared to traditional global co-registration techniques. Improved robustness (lower susceptibility to outliers) was demonstrated with ABC through lower inter-subject RMS error variance compared with traditional co-registration methods. The use of easily available and validated tools (AFNI and FSL) for this method should ease adoption by other investigators interested in brainstem data group analysis.},

abstract = {Adaptive goal-directed actions require the ability to quickly relearn behaviors in a changing environment, yet how the brain supports this ability is barely understood. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a novel reversal learning paradigm, the present study examined the neural mechanisms associated with reversal learning for outcomes versus motor responses. Participants were extensively trained to classify novel visual symbols (Japanese Hiraganas) into two arbitrary classes ("male" or "female"), in which subjects could acquire both stimulus-outcome associations and stimulus-response associations. They were then required to relearn either the outcome or the motor response associated with the symbols, or both. The results revealed that during reversal learning, a network including anterior cingulate, posterior inferior frontal, and parietal regions showed extended activation for all types of reversal trials, whereas their activation decreased quickly for trials not involving reversal, suggesting their role in domain-general interference resolution. The later increase of right ventral lateral prefrontal cortex and caudate for reversal of stimulus-outcome associations suggests their importance in outcome reversal learning in the face of interference.},

title = {Multiplicity of control in the basal ganglia: computational roles of striatal subregions},
abstract = {The basal ganglia, in particular the striatum, are central to theories of behavioral control, and often identified as a seat of action selection. Reinforcement learning (RL) models-which have driven much recent experimental work on this region-cast striatum as a dynamic controller, integrating sensory and motivational information to construct efficient and enriching behavioral policies. Befitting this informationally central role, the BG sit at the nexus of multiple anatomical 'loops' of synaptic projections, connecting a wide range of cortical and subcortical structures. Numerous pioneering anatomical studies conducted over the past several decades have meticulously catalogued these loops, and labeled them according to the inferred functions of the connected regions. The specific cotermina of the projections are highly localized to several different subregions of the striatum, leading to the suggestion that these subregions perform complementary but distinct functions. However, until recently, the dominant computational framework outlined only a bipartite, dorsal/ventral, division of striatum. We review recent computational and experimental advances that argue for a more finely fractionated delineation. In particular, experimental data provide extensive insight into unique functions subserved by the dorsomedial striatum (DMS). These functions appear to correspond well with theories of a 'model-based' RL subunit, and may also shed light on the suborganization of ventral striatum. Finally, we discuss the limitations of these ideas and how they point the way toward future refinements of neurocomputational theories of striatal function, bringing them into contact with other areas of computational theory and other regions of the brain.},

title = {Contributions of the amygdala to reward expectancy and choice signals in human prefrontal cortex},
abstract = {The prefrontal cortex (PFC) receives substantial anatomical input from the amygdala, and these two structures have long been implicated in reward-related learning and decision making. Yet little is known about how these regions interact, especially in humans. We investigated the contribution of the amygdala to reward-related signals in PFC by scanning two rare subjects with focal bilateral amygdala lesions using fMRI. The subjects performed a reversal learning task in which they first had to learn which of two choices was the more rewarding, and then flexibly switch their choices when contingencies changed. Compared with healthy controls, both amygdala lesion subjects showed a profound change in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activity associated with reward expectation and behavioral choice. These findings support a critical role for the human amygdala in establishing expected reward representations in PFC, which in turn may be used to guide behavioral choice.},

title = {Intrinsic fluctuations within cortical systems account for intertrial variability in human behavior},
abstract = {The resting brain is not silent, but exhibits organized fluctuations in neuronal activity even in the absence of tasks or stimuli. This intrinsic brain activity persists during task performance and contributes to variability in evoked brain responses. What is unknown is if this intrinsic activity also contributes to variability in behavior. In the current fMRI study, we identify a relationship between human brain activity in the left somatomotor cortex and spontaneous trial-to-trial variability in button press force. We then demonstrate that 74% of this brain-behavior relationship is attributable to ongoing fluctuations in intrinsic activity similar to those observed during resting fixation. In addition to establishing a functional and behavioral significance of intrinsic brain activity, these results lend new insight into the origins of variability in human behavior.},

abstract = {Humans can experience aftereffects from oriented stimuli that are not consciously perceived, suggesting that such stimuli receive cortical processing. Determining the physiological substrate of such effects has proven elusive owing to the low spatial resolution of conventional human neuroimaging techniques compared to the size of orientation columns in visual cortex. Here we show that even at conventional resolutions it is possible to use fMRI to obtain a direct measure of orientation-selective processing in V1. We found that many parts of V1 show subtle but reproducible biases to oriented stimuli, and that we could accumulate this information across the whole of V1 using multivariate pattern recognition. Using this information, we could then successfully predict which one of two oriented stimuli a participant was viewing, even when masking rendered that stimulus invisible. Our findings show that conventional fMRI can be used to reveal feature-selective processing in human cortex, even for invisible stimuli.},

title = {An assessment of microbiological water quality of six water source categories in north-east Uganda},
abstract = {Target 7C of the Millennium Development Goals is to "halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation". However, the corresponding indicator measures the "proportion of population using an improved drinking water source". This raises the question of whether "safe" and "improved" can be used interchangeably. This paper tests this hypothesis by comparing microbiological water quality in 346 different water sources across the District of Amuria in Uganda to each other and to defined standards, including the WHO drinking water standard of zero TTC per 100 ml, and the Ugandan national standard of 50 TTC per 100 ml. The water sources were grouped into six different categories: boreholes, protected springs, covered hand dug wells, open hand dug wells, open water and roofwater harvesting. The paper concludes that the ranking from the highest to the lowest microbiological quality water was: boreholes, protected springs and roofwater harvesting, open and covered hand dug wells, open water. It also concludes that sanitary surveys cannot be used to predict water quality precisely; however they are an essential component of the monitoring of safe water supplies.},

However, electrophysiological and neurochemical studies during specific behavioral tasks demonstrate a more restricted spectrum of dopamine-mediated changes. Substantial increases in dopamine-mediated activity, as measured by electrophysiology or voltammetry, are related to rewards and reward-predicting stimuli. A somewhat slower, distinct electrophysiological response encodes the uncertainty associated with rewards. Aversive events produce different, mostly slower, electrophysiological dopamine responses that consist predominantly of depressions. Additionally, more modest dopamine concentration fluctuations, related to punishment and movement, are seen at 200-18 000 times longer time courses using voltammetry and microdialysis in vivo. Using these responses, dopamine neurotransmission provides differential and heterogeneous information to subcortical and cortical brain structures about essential outcome components for approach behavior, learning and economic decision-making.},

title = {Combining multivariate voxel selection and support vector machines for mapping and classification of fMRI spatial patterns},
abstract = {In functional brain mapping, pattern recognition methods allow detecting multivoxel patterns of brain activation which are informative with respect to a subject's perceptual or cognitive state. The sensitivity of these methods, however, is greatly reduced when the proportion of voxels that convey the discriminative information is small compared to the total number of measured voxels. To reduce this dimensionality problem, previous studies employed univariate voxel selection or region-of-interest-based strategies as a preceding step to the application of machine learning algorithms. Here we employ a strategy for classifying functional imaging data based on a multivariate feature selection algorithm, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) that uses the training algorithm (support vector machine) recursively to eliminate irrelevant voxels and estimate informative spatial patterns. Generalization performances on test data increases while features/voxels are pruned based on their discrimination ability. In this article we evaluate RFE in terms of sensitivity of discriminative maps (Receiver Operative Characteristic analysis) and generalization performances and compare it to previously used univariate voxel selection strategies based on activation and discrimination measures. Using simulated fMRI data, we show that the recursive approach is suitable for mapping discriminative patterns and that the combination of an initial univariate activation-based (F-test) reduction of voxels and multivariate recursive feature elimination produces the best results, especially when differences between conditions have a low contrast-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, we apply our method to high resolution (2 x 2 x 2mm(3)) data from an auditory fMRI experiment in which subjects were stimulated with sounds from four different categories. With these real data, our recursive algorithm proves able to detect and accurately classify multivoxel spatial patterns, highlighting the role of the superior temporal gyrus in encoding the information of sound categories. In line with the simulation results, our method outperforms univariate statistical analysis and statistical learning without feature selection.},

title = {Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging: modelling, inference and optimization},
abstract = {Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging is a recent and popular technique for detecting haemodynamic responses to brief stimuli or events. However, the design of event-related experiments requires careful consideration of numerous issues of measurement, modelling and inference. Here we review these issues, with particular emphasis on the use of basis functions within a general linear modelling framework to model and make inferences about the haemodynamic response. With these models in mind, we then consider how the properties of functional magnetic resonance imaging data determine the optimal experimental design for a specific hypothesis, in terms of stimulus ordering and interstimulus interval. Finally, we illustrate various event-related models with examples from recent studies.},

These emotions are mediated by a cognitive process known as counterfactual thinking. By manipulating a simple gambling task, we characterized a subject's choices in terms of their anticipated and actual emotional impact. Normal subjects reported emotional responses consistent with counterfactual thinking; they chose to minimize future regret and learned from their emotional experience. Patients with orbitofrontal cortical lesions, however, did not report regret or anticipate negative consequences of their choices. The orbitofrontal cortex has a fundamental role in mediating the experience of regret.},

abstract = {Neurotrophins provide trophic and tropic support for different neuronal subpopulations in the developing and adult nervous systems. Expression of the neurotrophins and their receptors can be altered in several different disease or injury states that impact upon the functions in the central and peripheral nervous systems. The intracellular signals used by the neurotrophins are triggered by ligand binding to the cell surface Trk and p75NTR receptors. In general, signals emanating from Trk receptors support survival, growth and synaptic strengthening, while those emanating from p75NTR induce apoptosis, attenuate growth and weaken synaptic signaling. Mature neurotrophins are the preferred ligand for Trk proteins while p75NTR binds preferentially to the proneurotrophins and serves as a signaling component of the receptor complex for growth inhibitory molecules of central nervous system myelin {\$}[{\$}ie, myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein (OMgP) and Nogo{\$}]{\$}. The functional antagonism between Trk and p75NTR signaling may significantly impact the pathogenesis of human neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases and further complicate therapeutic uses of exogenous neurotrophins.

Many theories of vision have been premised on the central role played by prediction. Yet, implicit prediction in human vision has been difficult to assess in the laboratory, and many results have not distinguished between the indisputably important role of memory and the future-oriented aspect of prediction. Now, a new and unexpected finding - that humans can resume an interrupted visual search much faster than they can start a new search - offers new hope, because the rapid resumption of a search seems to depend on participants forming an implicit prediction of what they will see after the interruption. These findings combined with results of recent neurophysiology studies provide a framework for studying implicit prediction in perception.},

abstract = {Dopamine is released from both axonal and somatodendritic sites of midbrain dopaminergic neurons in an action potential-dependent manner. In contrast to the majority of central neurons, the axon of dopaminergic neurons typically originates from a dendritic site, suggesting a specialized computational function. Here, we examine the initiation and spread of action potentials in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars reticulata and reveal that the displacement of the axon to a dendritic site allows highly compartmentalized electrical signaling. In response to a train of synaptic input, action potentials initiated at axon-bearing dendritic sites formed a variable trigger for invasion to the soma and contralateral dendritic tree, with action potentials often confined to the axon-bearing dendrite. The application of dopamine increased this form of electrical compartmentalization, an effect mediated by a tonic membrane potential hyperpolarization leading to an increased availability of a class of voltage-dependent potassium channel. These data suggest that the release of dopamine from axonal and somatodendritic sites are dissociable, and that dopamine levels within the midbrain are dynamically controlled by the somatodendritic spread of action potentials.},

Self-mutilative behavior is a hallmark of the disease. Hyperuricemia leads to hyperuricuria and uric acid nephrolithiasis. The underlying defect is a deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine-phosphoribosyl transferase. We report on a 7-year-old boy with Lesch--Nyhan syndrome, lacking self-mutilative behavior, who was erroneously diagnosed as having athetotic cerebral palsy. He also had no renal stones; hyperechoic renal medullary pyramids were the only renal abnormality detected and were sonographically indistinguishable from medullary nephrocalcinosis.},

title = {Impact of expected reward on neuronal activity in prefrontal cortex, frontal and supplementary eye fields and premotor cortex},
abstract = {In several regions of the macaque brain, neurons fire during delayed response tasks at a rate determined by the value of the reward expected at the end of the trial. The activity of these neurons might be related either to the internal representation of the appetitive value of the expected reward or to motivation-dependent variations in the monkey's level of motor preparation or motor output. According to the first interpretation, reward-related activity should be most prominent in areas affiliated with the limbic system. According to the second interpretation, it should be most prominent in areas affiliated with the motor system. To distinguish between these alternatives, we carried out single-neuron recording while monkeys performed a memory-guided saccade task in which a visual cue presented early in each trial indicated whether the reward would be large or small. Neuronal activity accompanying task performance was monitored in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), the frontal eye field (FEF), a transitional zone caudal to the frontal eye field (FEF/PM), premotor cortex (PM), the supplementary eye field (SEF), and the rostral part of the supplementary motor area (SMAr). The tendency for neuronal activity to increase after cues that predicted a large reward became progressively stronger in progressively more posterior areas both in the lateral sector of the frontal lobe (PFC < FEF < FEF/PM < PM) and in the medial sector (SEF < SMAr). The very strong reward-related activity of premotor neurons was presumably attributable to the monkey's motivation-dependent level of motor preparation or motor output. This finding points to the need to determine whether reward-related activity in other nonlimbic brain areas, including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the dorsal striatum, genuinely represents the value of the expected reward or, alternatively, is related to motivational modulation of motor signals.},

title = {Network analysis of single-subject fMRI during a finger opposition task},
abstract = {The analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data has typically relied on univariate methods to identify areas of brain activity related to cognitive and behavioral task performance. We investigated the ability of multivariate network analysis using a modified form of principal component analysis, the Scaled Subprofile Model (SSM), applied to single-subject fMRI data to identify patterns of interactions among brain regions over time during an anatomically well-characterized simple motor task. We hypothesized that each subject would exhibit correlated patterns of brain activation in several regions known to participate in the regulation of movement including the contralateral motor cortex and the ipsilateral cerebellum. EPI BOLD images were acquired in six healthy participants as they performed a visually and auditorally paced finger opposition task. SSM analysis was applied to the fMR time series on a single-subject basis. Linear combinations of the major principal components that predicted the expected hemodynamic response to the order of experimental conditions were identified for each participant. These combinations of SSM patterns were highly associated with the expected hemodynamic response, an indicator of local neuronal activity, in each participant (0.84 </= R(2) </= 0.97, all P's < 0.0001). As predicted, the combined pattern in each subject was characterized most prominently by relatively increased activations in contralateral sensorimotor cortex and ipsilateral cerebellum. Additionally, all subjects showed areas of relatively decreased activation in the ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex and contralateral cerebellum. The application of network analysis methods, such as SSM, to single-subject fMRI data can identify patterns of task-specific, functionally interacting brain areas in individual subjects. This approach may help identify individual differences in the task-related functional connectivity, track changes in task-related patterns of activity within or between fMRI sessions, and provide a method to identify individual differences in response to treatment.},

The zonal architecture of these DA neurons is likely to reveal the functional organization of aversive and appetitive memory in the mushroom bodies. Combinations of fly DA neurons might code negative and positive value, consistent with a motivational systems role as proposed in mammals.},

abstract = {It is commonly accepted that reward is an effective motivator of behavior, but little is known about potential costs resulting from reward associations. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural underpinnings of such reward-related performance-disrupting effects in a reward-modulated Stroop task in humans. While reward associations in the task-relevant dimension (i.e., ink color) facilitated performance, behavioral detriments were found when the task-irrelevant dimension (i.e., word meaning) implicitly referred to reward-predictive ink colors. Neurally, only relevant reward associations invoked a typical reward-anticipation response in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), which was in turn predictive of behavioral facilitation. In contrast, irrelevant reward associations increased activity in a medial prefrontal motor-control-related region, namely the presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA), which likely reflects the preemption and inhibition of automatic response tendencies that are amplified by irrelevant reward-related words. This view was further supported by a positive relationship between pre-SMA activity and pronounced response slowing in trials containing reward-related as compared with reward-unrelated incongruent words. Importantly, the distinct neural processes related to the beneficial and detrimental behavioral effects of reward associations appeared to arise from preferential-coding mechanisms in visual-processing areas that were shared by the two stimulus dimensions, suggesting a transfer of reward-related saliency to the irrelevant dimension, but with highly differential behavioral and neural ramifications. More generally, the data demonstrate that even entirely irrelevant reward associations can influence stimulus-processing and response-selection pathways relatively automatically, thereby representing an important flipside of reward-driven performance enhancements.},

title = {Mesolimbic functional magnetic resonance imaging activations during reward anticipation correlate with reward-related ventral striatal dopamine release},
abstract = {The dopaminergic mechanisms that control reward-motivated behavior are the subject of intense study, but it is yet unclear how, in humans, neural activity in mesolimbic reward-circuitry and its functional neuroimaging correlates are related to dopamine release. To address this question, we obtained functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures of reward-related neural activity and [(11)C]raclopride positron emission tomography measures of dopamine release in the same human participants, while they performed a delayed monetary incentive task. Across the cohort, a positive correlation emerged between neural activity of the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA), the main origin of dopaminergic neurotransmission, during reward anticipation and reward-related [(11)C]raclopride displacement as an index of dopamine release in the ventral striatum, major target of SN/VTA dopamine neurons. Neural activity in the ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens itself also correlated with ventral striatal dopamine release. Additionally, high-reward-related dopamine release was associated with increased activation of limbic structures, such as the amygdala and the hippocampus. The observed correlations of reward-related mesolimbic fMRI activation and dopamine release provide evidence that dopaminergic neurotransmission plays a quantitative role in human mesolimbic reward processing. Moreover, the combined neurochemical and hemodynamic imaging approach used here opens up new perspectives for the investigation of molecular mechanisms underlying human cognition.},

Compound presentation produced the usual over-expectation decrement in responding to the individual stimuli. However, testing in an alternative, but similarly treated, context allowed renewal of the initial responding to the individual stimuli. This renewal is similar to that seen after a decrement produced by nonreinforcement. It joins other results in suggesting that the decrement produced in extinction and overexpectation may be due to the same mechanism.},

abstract = {Comparative studies have implicated striatal and mesial forebrain circuitry in the generation of autonomic, endocrine, and behavioral responses for incentives. Using blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging, we sought to visualize functional activation of these regions in 12 normal volunteers as they anticipated and responded for monetary incentives. Both individual and group analyses of time-series data revealed significant activation of striatal and mesial forebrain structures (including insula, caudate, putamen, and mesial prefrontal cortex) during trials involving both monetary rewards and punishments. In addition to these areas, during trials involving punishment, group analysis revealed activation foci in the anterior cingulate and thalamus. These results corroborate comparative studies which implicate striatal and mesial forebrain circuitry in the elaboration of incentive-driven behavior. This report also introduces a new paradigm for probing the functional integrity of this circuitry in humans.},

We used fMRI tailored to directly image the brainstem. When primary rewards were used in an experiment, the VTA blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response reflected a positive reward prediction error, whereas the VStr encoded positive and negative reward prediction errors. When monetary gains and losses were used, VTA BOLD responses reflected positive reward prediction errors modulated by the probability of winning. We detected no significant VTA BOLD response to nonrewarding events.},

Is there any systematic organization across the many diverse areas that comprise the PFC, or is it uniquely adaptive such that no fixed representational structure can develop? Going against the current tide, this paper argues that there is indeed a systematic organization across PFC areas, with an important functional distinction between ventral and dorsal regions characterized as processing What versus How information, respectively. This distinction has implications for the rostro-caudal and medial-lateral axes of organization as well. The resulting large-scale functional map of PFC could prove useful in integrating diverse data, and in generating novel predictions.},

title = {Factors critical for the plasticity of dendritic spines and memory storage},
abstract = {The structure of dendritic spines is highly plastic and responds to synaptic activity, including activity patterns that induce long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD). Induction of LTP causes enlargement of spine heads, while LTD causes spine head shrinkage. In addition, spine structure is well associated with synaptic weight and the extent of synaptic plasticity, such that structural changes of the spine may represent forms of memory storage. While the correlation between structural and functional plasticity appears to be simple, the underlying mechanisms of spine plasticity are intricate. Spine plasticity requires multiple molecular interactions, and is affected by the surrounding environment and by cellular metabolic state. Here, I synthesize the latest progress in this field by defining six determinants of spine plasticity, and discuss the role of each factor in memory storage.},

title = {Validity and power in hemodynamic response modeling: a comparison study and a new approach},
abstract = {One of the advantages of event-related functional MRI (fMRI) is that it permits estimation of the shape of the hemodynamic response function (HRF) elicited by cognitive events. Although studies to date have focused almost exclusively on the magnitude of evoked HRFs across different tasks, there is growing interest in testing other statistics, such as the time-to-peak and duration of activation as well. Although there are many ways to estimate such parameters, we suggest three criteria for optimal estimation: 1) the relationship between parameter estimates and neural activity must be as transparent as possible; 2) parameter estimates should be independent of one another, so that true differences among conditions in one parameter (e.g., hemodynamic response delay) are not confused for apparent differences in other parameters (e.g., magnitude); and 3) statistical power should be maximized. In this work, we introduce a new modeling technique, based on the superposition of three inverse logit functions (IL), designed to achieve these criteria. In simulations based on real fMRI data, we compare the IL model with several other popular methods, including smooth finite impulse response (FIR) models, the canonical HRF with derivatives, nonlinear fits using a canonical HRF, and a standard canonical model. The IL model achieves the best overall balance between parameter interpretability and power. The FIR model was the next-best choice, with gains in power at some cost to parameter independence. We provide software implementing the IL model.},

abstract = {The functions of rewards are based primarily on their effects on behavior and are less directly governed by the physics and chemistry of input events as in sensory systems. Therefore, the investigation of neural mechanisms underlying reward functions requires behavioral theories that can conceptualize the different effects of rewards on behavior. The scientific investigation of behavioral processes by animal learning theory and economic utility theory has produced a theoretical framework that can help to elucidate the neural correlates for reward functions in learning, goal-directed approach behavior, and decision making under uncertainty. Individual neurons can be studied in the reward systems of the brain, including dopamine neurons, orbitofrontal cortex, and striatum. The neural activity can be related to basic theoretical terms of reward and uncertainty, such as contiguity, contingency, prediction error, magnitude, probability, expected value, and variance.},

title = {Judging semantic similarity: an event-related fMRI study with auditory word stimuli},
abstract = {Much of mental life consists in thinking about object concepts that are not currently within the scope of perception. The general system that enables multiple representations to be maintained and compared is referred to as "working memory" [Repovs G, Baddeley A (2006) Neuroscience 139:5-21], and involves regions in medial and lateral parietal and frontal cortex [e.g., Smith EE, Jonides J (1999) Science 283:1657-1661]. It has been assumed that the contents of working memory index information in regions of the brain that are critical for processing and storing object knowledge. To study the processes involved in thinking about common object concepts, we used event related fMRI to study BOLD activity while participants made judgments of conceptual similarity over pairs of sequentially presented auditory words. Through a combination of conventional fMRI analysis approaches and multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), we show that the brain responses associated with the second word in a pair carry information about the conceptual similarity between the two members of the pair. This was the case in frontal and parietal regions involved in the working memory and decision components of the task for both analysis approaches. However, in other regions of the brain, including early visual regions, MVPA permitted classification of semantic distance relationships where conventional averaging approaches failed to show a difference. These findings suggest that diffuse and statistically sub-threshold "scattering" of BOLD activity in some regions may carry substantial information about the contents of mental representations.},

title = {Tonic dopamine modulates exploitation of reward learning},
abstract = {The impact of dopamine on adaptive behavior in a naturalistic environment is largely unexamined. Experimental work suggests that phasic dopamine is central to reinforcement learning whereas tonic dopamine may modulate performance without altering learning per se; however, this idea has not been developed formally or integrated with computational models of dopamine function. We quantitatively evaluate the role of tonic dopamine in these functions by studying the behavior of hyperdopaminergic DAT knockdown mice in an instrumental task in a semi-naturalistic homecage environment. In this "closed economy" paradigm, subjects earn all of their food by pressing either of two levers, but the relative cost for food on each lever shifts frequently. Compared to wild-type mice, hyperdopaminergic mice allocate more lever presses on high-cost levers, thus working harder to earn a given amount of food and maintain their body weight. However, both groups show a similarly quick reaction to shifts in lever cost, suggesting that the hyperdominergic mice are not slower at detecting changes, as with a learning deficit. We fit the lever choice data using reinforcement learning models to assess the distinction between acquisition and expression the models formalize. In these analyses, hyperdopaminergic mice displayed normal learning from recent reward history but diminished capacity to exploit this learning: a reduced coupling between choice and reward history. These data suggest that dopamine modulates the degree to which prior learning biases action selection and consequently alters the expression of learned, motivated behavior.},

title = {Dopamine-mediated learning and switching in cortico-striatal circuit explain behavioral changes in reinforcement learning},
abstract = {The basal ganglia are thought to play a crucial role in reinforcement learning. Central to the learning mechanism are dopamine (DA) D1 and D2 receptors located in the cortico-striatal synapses. However, it is still unclear how this DA-mediated synaptic plasticity is deployed and coordinated during reward-contingent behavioral changes. Here we propose a computational model of reinforcement learning that uses different thresholds of D1- and D2-mediated synaptic plasticity which are antagonized by DA-independent synaptic plasticity. A phasic increase in DA release caused by a larger-than-expected reward induces long-term potentiation (LTP) in the direct pathway, whereas a phasic decrease in DA release caused by a smaller-than-expected reward induces a cessation of long-term depression, leading to LTP in the indirect pathway. This learning mechanism can explain the robust behavioral adaptation observed in a location-reward-value-association task where the animal makes shorter latency saccades to reward locations. The changes in saccade latency become quicker as the monkey becomes more experienced. This behavior can be explained by a switching mechanism which activates the cortico-striatal circuit selectively. Our model also shows how D1- or D2-receptor blocking experiments affect selectively either reward or no-reward trials. The proposed mechanisms also explain the behavioral changes in Parkinson's disease.},

title = {Excitatory transmission from the amygdala to nucleus accumbens facilitates reward seeking},
abstract = {The basolateral amygdala (BLA) has a crucial role in emotional learning irrespective of valence. The BLA projection to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is thought to modulate cue-triggered motivated behaviours, but our understanding of the interaction between these two brain regions has been limited by the inability to manipulate neural-circuit elements of this pathway selectively during behaviour. To circumvent this limitation, we used in vivo optogenetic stimulation or inhibition of glutamatergic fibres from the BLA to the NAc, coupled with intracranial pharmacology and ex vivo electrophysiology. Here we show that optical stimulation of the pathway from the BLA to the NAc in mice reinforces behavioural responding to earn additional optical stimulation of these synaptic inputs. Optical stimulation of these glutamatergic fibres required intra-NAc dopamine D1-type receptor signalling, but not D2-type receptor signalling. Brief optical inhibition of fibres from the BLA to the NAc reduced cue-evoked intake of sucrose, demonstrating an important role of this specific pathway in controlling naturally occurring reward-related behaviour. Moreover, although optical stimulation of glutamatergic fibres from the medial prefrontal cortex to the NAc also elicited reliable excitatory synaptic responses, optical self-stimulation behaviour was not observed by activation of this pathway. These data indicate that whereas the BLA is important for processing both positive and negative affect, the glutamatergic pathway from the BLA to the NAc, in conjunction with dopamine signalling in the NAc, promotes motivated behavioural responding. Thus, optogenetic manipulation of anatomically distinct synaptic inputs to the NAc reveals functionally distinct properties of these inputs in controlling reward-seeking behaviours.},

title = {Rapid three-dimensional functional magnetic resonance imaging of the initial negative BOLD response},
abstract = {Functional MRI is most commonly used to study the local changes in blood flow that accompanies neuronal activity. In this work we introduce a new approach towards acquiring and analyzing fMRI data that instead provides the potential to study the initial oxygen consumption in the brain that accompanies activation. As the oxygen consumption is closer in timing to the underlying neuronal activity than the subsequent blood flow, this approach promises to provide more precise information about the location and timing of activity. Our approach is based on using a new single shot 3D echo-volumar imaging sequence which samples a small central region of 3D k-space every 100ms, thereby giving a low spatial resolution snapshot of the brain with extremely high temporal resolution. Explicit and simple rules for implementing the trajectory are provided, together with a straightforward reconstruction algorithm. Using our approach allows us to effectively study the behavior of the brain in the time immediately following activation through the initial negative BOLD response, and we discuss new techniques for detecting the presence of the negative response across the brain. The feasibility and efficiency of the approach is confirmed using data from a visual-motor task and an auditory-motor-visual task. The results of these experiments provide a proof of concept of our methodology, and indicate that rapid imaging of the initial negative BOLD response can serve an important role in studying cognition tasks involving rapid mental processing in more than one region.},

It will be argued that human orbitofrontal cortex is involved in a number of distinct functions: signaling the affective value of stimuli as they are perceived, encoding expectations of future reward, and updating these expectations, either by making use of prediction error signals generated in the midbrain, or by using knowledge of the rules or structure of the decision problem. It will also be suggested that this region contributes to the decision making process itself, by encoding signals that inform an individual about what action to take next. Evidence for functional specialization within orbitofrontal cortex in terms of valence will also be evaluated, and the possible contributions of the orbitofrontal cortex in representing the values of actions as well as that of stimuli will be discussed. Finally, some of the outstanding questions for future neuroimaging research of orbitofrontal cortex function will be highlighted.},

abstract = {The ability to correctly interpret emotional signals from others is crucial for successful social interaction. Previous neuroimaging studies showed that voice-sensitive auditory areas activate to a broad spectrum of vocally expressed emotions more than to neutral speech melody (prosody). However, this enhanced response occurs irrespective of the specific emotion category, making it impossible to distinguish different vocal emotions with conventional analyses. Here, we presented pseudowords spoken in five prosodic categories (anger, sadness, neutral, relief, joy) during event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), then employed multivariate pattern analysis to discriminate between these categories on the basis of the spatial response pattern within the auditory cortex. Our results demonstrate successful decoding of vocal emotions from fMRI responses in bilateral voice-sensitive areas, which could not be obtained by using averaged response amplitudes only. Pairwise comparisons showed that each category could be classified against all other alternatives, indicating for each emotion a specific spatial signature that generalized across speakers. These results demonstrate for the first time that emotional information is represented by distinct spatial patterns that can be decoded from brain activity in modality-specific cortical areas.},

abstract = {In probabilistic decision tasks, an expected value (EV) of a choice is calculated, and after the choice has been made, this can be updated based on a temporal difference (TD) prediction error between the EV and the reward magnitude (RM) obtained. The EV is measured as the probability of obtaining a reward x RM. To understand the contribution of different brain areas to these decision-making processes, functional magnetic resonance imaging activations related to EV versus RM (or outcome) were measured in a probabilistic decision task. Activations in the medial orbitofrontal cortex were correlated with both RM and with EV and confirmed in a conjunction analysis to extend toward the pregenual cingulate cortex. From these representations, TD reward prediction errors could be produced. Activations in areas that receive from the orbitofrontal cortex including the ventral striatum, midbrain, and inferior frontal gyrus were correlated with the TD error. Activations in the anterior insula were correlated negatively with EV, occurring when low reward outcomes were expected, and also with the uncertainty of the reward, implicating this region in basic and crucial decision-making parameters, low expected outcomes, and uncertainty.},

abstract = {Although it has been shown that the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) are critical for goal-directed instrumental performance, much remains unknown about the respective contributions of these structures to action selection. The current study assessed the effects of post-training BLA and MD lesions on several tests of instrumental action selection. We found that MD damage disrupted the influence of pavlovian cues over action selection but left intact rats' ability to select actions based on either the expected value or the discriminative stimulus properties of the outcome. In contrast, BLA lesions impaired performance on all three tests of action selection. Because both lesion types disrupted the influence of cues that signal reward over instrumental performance, we then investigated the involvement of these structures in pavlovian contingency learning using a task in which the predictive status of one of two cues is degraded by delivering its outcome noncontingently during the intertrial interval. As expected, the sham group selectively suppressed their conditioned approach performance to the cue that no longer signaled its outcome but continued to respond to the control stimulus. In contrast, both lesioned groups were impaired on this task. Interestingly, whereas the MD group displayed a nonspecific reduction in responding to both cues, the BLA group continued to show high levels of responding to both cues as if their performance was completely insensitive to this contingency manipulation. These findings demonstrate that the BLA and MD make important yet distinct contributions to instrumental action selection.},

abstract = {Placebo-induced expectancies have been shown to decrease pain in a manner reversible by opioid antagonists, but little is known about the central brain mechanisms of opioid release during placebo treatment. This study examined placebo effects in pain by using positron-emission tomography with [(11)C]carfentanil, which measures regional mu-opioid receptor availability in vivo. Noxious thermal stimulation was applied at the same temperature for placebo and control conditions. Placebo treatment affected endogenous opioid activity in a number of predicted mu-opioid receptor-rich regions that play central roles in pain and affect, including periaqueductal gray and nearby dorsal raphe and nucleus cuneiformis, amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, insula, rostral anterior cingulate, and lateral prefrontal cortex. These regions appeared to be subdivided into two sets, one showing placebo-induced opioid activation specific to noxious heat and the other showing placebo-induced opioid reduction during warm stimulation in anticipation of pain. These findings suggest that a mechanism of placebo analgesia is the potentiation of endogenous opioid responses to noxious stimuli. Opioid activity in many of these regions was correlated with placebo effects in reported pain. Connectivity analyses on individual differences in endogenous opioid system activity revealed that placebo treatment increased functional connectivity between the periaqueductal gray and rostral anterior cingulate, as hypothesized a priori, and also increased connectivity among a number of limbic and prefrontal regions, suggesting increased functional integration of opioid responses. Overall, the results suggest that endogenous opioid release in core affective brain regions is an integral part of the mechanism whereby expectancies regulate affective and nociceptive circuits.},

title = {Neural correlates of metaphor processing: the roles of figurativeness, familiarity and difficulty},
abstract = {There is currently much interest in investigating the neural substrates of metaphor processing. In particular, it has been suggested that the right hemisphere plays a special role in the comprehension of figurative (non-literal) language, and in particular metaphors. However, some studies find no evidence of right hemisphere involvement in metaphor comprehension (e.g. [Lee, S. S., {\&} Dapretto, M. (2006). Metaphorical vs. literal word meanings: fMRI evidence against a selective role of the right hemisphere. NeuroImage, 29, 536-544; Rapp, A. M., Leube, D. T., Erb, M., Grodd, W., {\&} Kircher, T. T. J. (2004). Neural correlates of metaphor processing. Cognitive Brain Research, 20, 395-402]). We suggest that lateralization differences between literal and metaphorical language may be due to factors such as differences in familiarity ([Schmidt, G. L., DeBuse, C. J., {\&} Seger, C. A. (2007). Right hemisphere metaphor processing? Characterizing the lateralization of semantic processes. Brain and Language, 100, 127-141]), or difficulty ([Bookheimer, S. (2002). Functional MRI of language: New approaches to understanding the cortical organization of semantic processing. Annual Review of Neuroscience, 25, 151-188; Rapp, A. M., Leube, D. T., Erb, M., Grodd, W., {\&} Kircher, T. T. J. (2004). Neural correlates of metaphor processing. Cognitive Brain Research, 20, 395-402]) in addition to figurativeness. The purpose of this study was to separate the effects of figurativeness, familiarity, and difficulty on the recruitment of neural systems involved in language, in particular right hemisphere mechanisms. This was achieved by comparing neural activation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) between four conditions: literal sentences, familiar and easy to understand metaphors, unfamiliar and easy to understand metaphors, and unfamiliar and difficult to understand metaphors. Metaphors recruited the right insula, left temporal pole and right inferior frontal gyrus in comparison with literal sentences. Familiar metaphors recruited the right middle frontal gyrus when contrasted with unfamiliar metaphors. Easy metaphors showed higher activation in the left middle frontal gyrus as compared to difficult metaphors, while difficult metaphors showed selective activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus as compared to easy metaphors. We conclude that the right hemisphere is involved in metaphor processing and that the factors of figurativeness, familiarity and difficulty are important in determining neural recruitment of semantic processing.},

abstract = {Conventional statistical analysis methods for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data are very successful at detecting brain regions that are activated as a whole during specific mental activities. The overall activation of a region is usually taken to indicate involvement of the region in the task. However, such activation analysis does not consider the multivoxel patterns of activity within a brain region. These patterns of activity, which are thought to reflect neuronal population codes, can be investigated by pattern-information analysis. In this framework, a region's multivariate pattern information is taken to indicate representational content. This tutorial introduction motivates pattern-information analysis, explains its underlying assumptions, introduces the most widespread methods in an intuitive way, and outlines the basic sequence of analysis steps.},

title = {Dopamine signaling in dorsal versus ventral striatum: the dynamic role of cholinergic interneurons},
abstract = {Mesostriatal dopaminergic neurons and striatal cholinergic interneurons participate in signaling the motivational significance of environmental stimuli and regulate striatal plasticity. Dopamine (DA) and acetylcholine (ACh) have potent interactions within the striatum at multiple levels that include presynaptic regulation of neurotransmitter release and postsynaptic effects in target cells (including ACh neurons). These interactions may be highly variable given the dynamic changes in the firing activities of parent DA and ACh neurons. Here, we consider how striatal ACh released from cholinergic interneurons acting at both nicotinic and muscarinic ACh receptors powerfully modulates DA transmission. This ACh-DA interaction varies in a manner that depends on the frequency of presynaptic activation, and will thus strongly influence how DA synapses convey discrete changes in DA neuron activity that are known to signal events of motivational salience. Furthermore, this ACh modulation of DA transmission within striatum occurs via different profiles of nicotinic and muscarinic receptors in caudate-putamen compared to nucleus accumbens, which may ultimately enable region-specific targeting of striatal function.},

title = {Probing the mysterious underpinnings of multi-voxel fMRI analyses},
abstract = {Various arguments have been proposed for or against sub-voxel sensitivity or hyperacuity in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at standard resolution. Sub-voxel sensitivity might exist, but nevertheless the performance of multi-voxel fMRI analyses is very likely to be dominated by a larger-scale organization, even if this organization is very weak. Up to now, most arguments are indirect in nature: they do not in themselves proof or contradict sub-voxel sensitivity, but they are suggestive, seem consistent or not with sub-voxel sensitivity, or show that the principle might or might not work. Here the previously proposed smoothing argument against hyperacuity is extended with simulations that include more realistic signal, noise, and analysis properties than any of the simulations presented before. These simulations confirm the relevance of the smoothing approach to find out the scale of the functional maps that underlie the outcome of multi-voxel analyses, at least in relative terms (differences in the scale of different maps). However, image smoothing, like most other arguments in the literature, is an indirect argument, and at the end of the day such arguments are not sufficient to decide the issue on whether and how much sub-voxel maps contribute. A few suggestions are made about the type of evidence that is needed to help us understand the as yet mysterious underpinnings of multi-voxel fMRI analyses.},

abstract = {Parkinson's disease arises from genetic and possibly neurotoxic causes that produce massive cell death of the neuromelanin-containing dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. Loss of these neurons is essential for the diagnostic parkinsonian features. Although many genetic mutations have been suggested as causes or risk factors for Parkinson's disease, the low penetrance of some mutations and the low disease concordance in relatives suggests that there must be interactions between multiple factors. We suggest that `multiple hits' that combine toxic stress, for example, from dopamine oxidation or mitochondrial dysfunction, with an inhibition of a neuroprotective response, such as loss of function of parkin or stress-induced autophagic degradation, underlie selective neuronal death. We discuss the properties of substantia nigra dopamine neurons that might make them particular targets of such multiple hits.},

title = {Neural substrates of visuomotor learning based on improved feedback control and prediction},
abstract = {Motor skills emerge from learning feedforward commands as well as improvements in feedback control. These two components of learning were investigated in a compensatory visuomotor tracking task on a trial-by-trial basis. Between-trial learning was characterized with a state-space model to provide smoothed estimates of feedforward and feedback learning, separable from random fluctuations in motor performance and error. The resultant parameters were correlated with brain activity using magnetic resonance imaging. Learning related to the generation of a feedforward command correlated with activity in dorsal premotor cortex, inferior parietal lobule, supplementary motor area and cingulate motor area, supporting a role of these areas in retrieving and executing a predictive motor command. Modulation of feedback control was associated with activity in bilateral posterior superior parietal lobule as well as right ventral premotor cortex. Performance error correlated with activity in a widespread cortical and subcortical network including bilateral parietal, premotor and rostral anterior cingulate cortex as well as the cerebellar cortex. Finally, trial-by-trial changes of kinematics, as measured by mean absolute hand acceleration, correlated with activity in motor cortex and anterior cerebellum. The results demonstrate that incremental, learning-dependent changes can be modeled on a trial-by-trial basis and neural substrates for feedforward control of novel motor programs are localized to secondary motor areas.},

title = {Blockade of NMDA receptors in the dorsomedial striatum prevents action-outcome learning in instrumental conditioning},
abstract = {Although there is consensus that instrumental conditioning depends on the encoding of action-outcome associations, it is not known where this learning process is localized in the brain. Recent research suggests that the posterior dorsomedial striatum (pDMS) may be the critical locus of these associations. We tested this hypothesis by examining the contribution of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in the pDMS to action-outcome learning. Rats with bilateral cannulae in the pDMS were first trained to perform two actions (left and right lever presses), for sucrose solution. After the pre-training phase, they were given an infusion of the NMDA antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (APV, 1 mg/mL) or artificial cerebral spinal fluid (ACSF) before a 30-min session in which pressing one lever delivered food pellets and pressing the other delivered fruit punch. Learning during this session was tested the next day by sating the animals on either the pellets or fruit punch before assessing their performance on the two levers in extinction. The ACSF group selectively reduced responding on the lever that, in training, had earned the now devalued outcome, whereas the APV group did not. Experiment 2 replicated the effect of APV during the critical training session but found no effect of APV given after acquisition and before test. Furthermore, Experiment 3 showed that the effect of APV on instrumental learning was restricted to the pDMS; infusion into the dorsolateral striatum did not prevent learning. These experiments provide the first direct evidence that, in instrumental conditioning, NMDARs in the dorsomedial striatum are involved in encoding action-outcome associations.},

So that the striatum-based mechanisms underlying habit formation could be studied, chronic recordings from ensembles of striatal neurons were made with multiple tetrodes as rats learned a T-maze procedural task. Large and widely distributed changes in the neuronal activity patterns occurred in the sensorimotor striatum during behavioral acquisition, culminating in task-related activity emphasizing the beginning and end of the automatized procedure. The new ensemble patterns remained stable during weeks of subsequent performance of the same task. These results suggest that the encoding of action in the sensorimotor striatum undergoes dynamic reorganization as habit learning proceeds.},

title = {How the Basal Ganglia Use Parallel Excitatory and Inhibitory Learning Pathways to Selectively Respond to Unexpected Rewarding Cues},
abstract = {After classically conditioned learning, dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) respond immediately to unexpected conditioned stimuli (CS) but omit formerly seen responses to expected unconditioned stimuli, notably rewards. These cells play an important role in reinforcement learning. A neural model explains the key neurophysiological properties of these cells before, during, and after conditioning, as well as related anatomical and neurophysiological data about the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTN), lateral hypothalamus, ventral striatum, and striosomes. The model proposes how two parallel learning pathways from limbic cortex to the SNc, one devoted to excitatory conditioning (through the ventral striatum, ventral pallidum, and PPTN) and the other to adaptively timed inhibitory conditioning (through the striosomes), control SNc responses. The excitatory pathway generates CS-induced excitatory SNc dopamine bursts. The inhibitory pathway prevents dopamine bursts in response to predictable reward-related signals. When expected rewards are not received, striosomal inhibition of SNc that is unopposed by excitation results in a phasic drop in dopamine cell activity. The adaptively timed inhibitory learning uses an intracellular spectrum of timed responses that is proposed to be similar to adaptively timed cellular mechanisms in the hippocampus and cerebellum. These mechanisms are proposed to include metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated Ca2+ spikes that occur with different delays in striosomal cells. A dopaminergic burst in concert with a Ca2+ spike is proposed to potentiate inhibitory learning. The model provides a biologically predictive alternative to temporal difference conditioning models and explains substantially more data than alternative models.},

This can be compared to the information transferred in particular models of the stimulus-response function and to maximum possible information transfer. Such comparisons are crucial because they validate assumptions present in any neurophysiological analysis. Here we review information-theory basics before demonstrating its use in neural coding. We show how to use information theory to validate simple stimulus-response models of neural coding of dynamic stimuli. Because these models require specification of spike timing precision, they can reveal which time scales contain information in neural coding. This approach shows that dynamic stimuli can be encoded efficiently by single neurons and that each spike contributes to information transmission. We argue, however, that the data obtained so far do not suggest a temporal code, in which the placement of spikes relative to each other yields additional information.},

title = {Role of primate basal ganglia and frontal cortex in the internal generation of movements. II. Movement-related activity in the anterior striatum},
abstract = {In order to more comprehensively assess the role of the basal ganglia in the internal generation of movements, we studied the activity of neurons in the head of the caudate and in the rostral putamen in relation to the execution of movements. Monkeys performed self-initiated and stimulus-triggered arm reaching movements in separate blocks of trials. With stimulus-triggered movements, 217 striatal neurons increased their activity after the trigger stimulus (127 in caudate, 90 in putamen). Of these, 68 neurons showed time-locked responses to the trigger stimulus, with a median latency of 60 ms, that were independent of visual or auditory stimulus modalities. Three quarters of responses were conditional on a movement being performed. These responses may participate in neuronal processes through which the reception of a stimulus is translated into the execution of a behavioral reaction. Further, 44 neurons increased their activity before the earliest muscle activity without being clearly time-locked to the stimulus (148-324 ms before movement onset), 55 neurons were activated later before the movement, and 50 neurons were activated after movement onset. With self-initiated movements, 106 striatal neurons showed movement-related activity beginning up to 460 ms before movement onset (52 in caudate, 54 in putamen). Comparisons between the two types of movement were made on 53 neurons with premovement activity beginning more than 500 ms before self-initiated movements. Only one fifth of them also showed movement-related activity with stimulus-triggered movements, including trigger responses. Comparisons among 39 neurons with movement-related activity during self-initiated arm movements showed that about half of them also showed movement-related activity with stimulus-triggered movements. These data demonstrate a considerably segregated population of striatal neurons engaged in the internal generation of movements, whereas processes underlying the execution of movements appear to involve overlapping neuronal populations.},

Yet changes in neural activity to an outcome or cues that precede it can reflect other processes. We review the recent literature and show that while activity in dopamine neurons appears to signal prediction errors, similar activity in orbitofrontal cortex, basolateral amygdala, and ventral striatum does not. Instead increased firing in basolateral amygdala to unexpected outcomes likely reflects attention whereas activity in orbitofrontal cortex and ventral striatum is unaffected by prior expectations and may provide information on outcome expectancy. These results have important implications for how these areas interact to facilitate learning and guide behavior.},

title = {Striatal contributions to reward and decision making: making sense of regional variations in a reiterated processing matrix},
abstract = {The striatum is the major input nucleus of the basal ganglia. It is thought to play a key role in learning on the basis of positive reinforcement and in action selection. One view of the striatum conceives it as comprising a reiterated matrix of processing units that perform common operations in different striatal regions, namely synaptic plasticity according to a three-factor rule, and lateral inhibition. These operations are required for reinforcement learning and selection of previously reinforced actions. Analysis of the behavioral effects of circumscribed lesions of the striatum, however, suggests regional specialization of learning and decision-making operations. We consider how a basic processing unit may be modified by regional variations in neurochemical parameters, for example, by the gradient in density of dopamine terminals from dorsal to ventral striatum. These variations suggest subtle differences between dorsolateral and ventromedial striatal regions in the temporal properties of dopamine signaling, which are superimposed on regional differences in connectivity. We propose that these variations make sense in relation to the temporal structure of activity in striatal inputs from different regions, and the requirements of different learning operations. Dorsolateral striatal (DLS) regions may be subject to brief, precisely timed pulses of dopamine, whereas ventromedial striatal regions integrate dopamine signals over a longer time course. These differences may be important for understanding regional variations in the contribution to reinforcement of habits, versus incentive processes that are sensitive to the value of expected rewards.},

title = {Learning arbitrary visuomotor associations: temporal dynamic of brain activity},
abstract = {Primates can give behavioral responses on the basis of arbitrary, context-dependent rules. When sensory instructions and behavioral responses are associated by arbitrary rules, these rules need to be learned. This study investigates the temporal dynamics of functional segregation at the basis of visuomotor associative learning in humans, isolating specific learning-related changes in neurovascular activity across the whole brain. We have used fMRI to measure human brain activity during performance of two tasks requiring the association of visual patterns with motor responses. Both tasks were learned by trial and error, either before (visuomotor control) or during (visuomotor learning) the scanning session. Epochs of tasks performance ( approximately 30 s) were alternated with a baseline period over the whole scanning session ( approximately 50 min). We have assessed both linear and nonlinear modulations in the differential signal between tasks, independently from overall task differences. The performance indices of the visuomotor learning task smoothly converged onto the values of a steady-state control condition, according to nonlinear timecourses. Specific visuomotor learning-related activity has been found over a distributed cortical network, centred on a temporo-prefrontal circuit. These cortical time-modulated activities were supported early in learning by the hippocampal/parahippocampal complex, and late in learning by the basal ganglia system. These findings suggest the inferior temporal and the ventral prefrontal cortex are critical neural nodes for integrating perceptual information with executive processes.},

abstract = {Conditional visuo-motor learning consists in learning by trial and error to associate visual cues with correct motor responses, that have no direct link. Converging evidence supports the role of a large brain network in this type of learning, including the prefrontal and the premotor cortex, the basal ganglia BG and the hippocampus. In this paper we focus on the role of a major structure of the BG, the striatum. We first present behavioral results and electrophysiological data recorded from this structure in monkeys engaged in learning new visuo-motor associations. Visual stimuli were presented on a video screen and the animals had to learn, by trial and error, to select the correct movement of a joystick, in order to receive a liquid reward. Behavioral results revealed that the monkeys used a sequential strategy, whereby they learned the associations one by one although they were presented randomly. Human subjects, tested on the same task, also used a sequential strategy. Neuronal recordings in monkeys revealed learning-related modulations of neural activity in the striatum. We then present a mathematical model inspired by viability theory developed to implement the use of strategies during learning. This model complements existing models of the BG based on reinforcement learning RL, which do not take into account the use of strategies to reduce the dimension of the learning space.},

title = {Stimulus Representation and the Timing of Reward-Prediction Errors in Models of the Dopamine System},
abstract = {The phasic firing of dopamine neurons has been theorized to encode a reward-prediction error as formalized by the temporal difference (TD) algorithm in reinforcement learning. Most TD models of dopamine have assumed a stimulus representation, known as the complete serial compound, in which each moment in a trial is distinctly represented. We introduce a more realistic temporal stimulus representation for the TD model. In our model, all external stimuli, including rewards, spawn a series of internal microstimuli, which grow weaker and more diffuse over time. These microstimuli are used by the TD learning algorithm to generate predictions of future reward. This new stimulus representation injects temporal generalization into the TD model and enhances correspondence between model and data in several experiments, including those when rewards are omitted or received early. This improved fit mostly derives from the absence of large negative errors in the new model, suggesting that dopamine alone can encode the full range of TD errors in these situations.},

title = {Neuronal activity related to anticipated reward in frontal cortex: does it represent value or reflect motivation?},
abstract = {It is thought that neuronal activity in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) represents the value of anticipated reward; however activity in many other brain areas also seems to reflect expected reward value. For example, we have shown that in monkeys performing a memory-guided saccade task for a reward of variable size, activity in numerous areas of frontal cortex is stronger when the monkey anticipates a larger reward. The activity of these neurons might be related to the value of the expected reward or to the degree of motivation induced by expectation of the reward. Anticipation of a more valued reward leads to stronger motivation, as evidenced by measures of arousal, attention, and intensity of motor output. On the assumption that motivated behavior depends on influences arising in the limbic system and acting on the motor system, we hypothesized that neuronal signals representing reward value are unique to OFC, whereas signals arising from other frontal areas, those more closely tied the motor system, reflect the degree of motivation. To test this hypothesis, we recorded from single neurons in OFC and premotor cortex while two monkeys performed a task in which we dissociated value from motivation. Neuronal activity in premotor cortex reflected the monkey's degree of motivation, presumably related to the monkey's level of motor readiness and movement preparation, whereas neuronal activity in OFC represented the value of expected reward.},

title = {Genetic triple dissociation reveals multiple roles for dopamine in reinforcement learning},
abstract = {What are the genetic and neural components that support adaptive learning from positive and negative outcomes? Here, we show with genetic analyses that three independent dopaminergic mechanisms contribute to reward and avoidance learning in humans. A polymorphism in the DARPP-32 gene, associated with striatal dopamine function, predicted relatively better probabilistic reward learning. Conversely, the C957T polymorphism of the DRD2 gene, associated with striatal D2 receptor function, predicted the degree to which participants learned to avoid choices that had been probabilistically associated with negative outcomes. The Val/Met polymorphism of the COMT gene, associated with prefrontal cortical dopamine function, predicted participants' ability to rapidly adapt behavior on a trial-to-trial basis. These findings support a neurocomputational dissociation between striatal and prefrontal dopaminergic mechanisms in reinforcement learning. Computational maximum likelihood analyses reveal independent gene effects on three reinforcement learning parameters that can explain the observed dissociations.},

title = {Impact of expected reward on neuronal activity in prefrontal cortex, frontal and supplementary eye fields and premotor cortex},
abstract = {In several regions of the macaque brain, neurons fire during delayed response tasks at a rate determined by the value of the reward expected at the end of the trial. The activity of these neurons might be related either to the internal representation of the appetitive value of the expected reward or to motivation-dependent variations in the monkey's level of motor preparation or motor output. According to the first interpretation, reward-related activity should be most prominent in areas affiliated with the limbic system. According to the second interpretation, it should be most prominent in areas affiliated with the motor system. To distinguish between these alternatives, we carried out single-neuron recording while monkeys performed a memory-guided saccade task in which a visual cue presented early in each trial indicated whether the reward would be large or small. Neuronal activity accompanying task performance was monitored in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), the frontal eye field (FEF), a transitional zone caudal to the frontal eye field (FEF/PM), premotor cortex (PM), the supplementary eye field (SEF), and the rostral part of the supplementary motor area (SMAr). The tendency for neuronal activity to increase after cues that predicted a large reward became progressively stronger in progressively more posterior areas both in the lateral sector of the frontal lobe (PFC < FEF < FEF/PM < PM) and in the medial sector (SEF < SMAr). The very strong reward-related activity of premotor neurons was presumably attributable to the monkey's motivation-dependent level of motor preparation or motor output. This finding points to the need to determine whether reward-related activity in other nonlimbic brain areas, including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the dorsal striatum, genuinely represents the value of the expected reward or, alternatively, is related to motivational modulation of motor signals.},

title = {Optimization of experimental design in fMRI: a general framework using a genetic algorithm},
abstract = {This article describes a method for selecting design parameters and a particular sequence of events in fMRI so as to maximize statistical power and psychological validity. Our approach uses a genetic algorithm (GA), a class of flexible search algorithms that optimize designs with respect to single or multiple measures of fitness. Two strengths of the GA framework are that (1) it operates with any sort of model, allowing for very specific parameterization of experimental conditions, including nonstandard trial types and experimentally observed scanner autocorrelation, and (2) it is flexible with respect to fitness criteria, allowing optimization over known or novel fitness measures. We describe how genetic algorithms may be applied to experimental design for fMRI, and we use the framework to explore the space of possible fMRI design parameters, with the goal of providing information about optimal design choices for several types of designs. In our simulations, we considered three fitness measures: contrast estimation efficiency, hemodynamic response estimation efficiency, and design counterbalancing. Although there are inherent trade-offs between these three fitness measures, GA optimization can produce designs that outperform random designs on all three criteria simultaneously.},

title = {Random neural networks with synchronized interactions},
abstract = {Large-scale distributed systems, such as natural neuronal and artificial systems, have many local interconnections, but they often also have the ability to propagate information very fast over relatively large distances. Mechanisms that enable such behavior include very long physical signaling paths and possibly saccades of synchronous behavior that may propagate across a network. This letter studies the modeling of such behaviors in neuronal networks and develops a related learning algorithm. This is done in the context of the random neural network (RNN), a probabilistic model with a well-developed mathematical theory, which was inspired by the apparently stochastic spiking behavior of certain natural neuronal systems. Thus, we develop an extension of the RNN to the case when synchronous interactions can occur, leading to synchronous firing by large ensembles of cells. We also present an O(N(3)) gradient descent learning algorithm for an N-cell recurrent network having both conventional excitatory-inhibitory interactions and synchronous interactions. Finally, the model and its learning algorithm are applied to a resource allocation problem that is NP-hard and requires fast approximate decisions.},

title = {Modeling state-related fMRI activity using change-point theory},
abstract = {The general linear model (GLM) approach has arguably become the dominant way to analyze functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. It tests whether activity in a brain region is systematically related to some known input function. However, the GLM becomes impractical when the precise timing and duration of psychological events cannot be specified a priori. In this work, we introduce a new analysis approach that allows the predicted signal to depend non-linearly on the input. The approach uses ideas from statistical control theory and change-point theory to model slowly varying processes for which the onset times and durations of underlying psychological activity are uncertain. Our approach is exploratory in nature, while retaining the inferential capabilities of the more rigid modeling approach. It is a multi-subject extension of the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) method used in change-point analysis. We extend existing EWMA models for individual subjects (a single time series) so that they are applicable to fMRI data, and develop a group analysis using a hierarchical model, which we term HEWMA (Hierarchical EWMA). The HEWMA method can be used to analyze fMRI data voxel-wise throughout the brain, data from regions of interest, or temporal components extracted using ICA or similar methods. We validate the false-positive rate control of the method and provide power estimates using simulations based on real fMRI data. We further apply this method to an fMRI study (n=24) of state anxiety.

Emerging technologies that employ artificially designed transcription factors could offer an alternative solution, as they can recognize target DNA sequences with high specificity. In addition, these artificial proteins can be used not only as transcriptional regulators but also as genome modifiers that cleave and stimulate mutations at desired positions in the genome. These nucleotide-targeting molecules must be delivered efficiently to the target cells to promote their therapeutic activity and several delivery technologies have been developed for this purpose.},

This paper relates the computational features of a DPM's loop through the basal ganglia to experimental results for two kinds of natural action selection. First, functional imaging during a serial order recall task was used to study human brain activity during the selection of sequential actions from working memory. Second, microelectrode recordings from monkeys trained in a step-tracking task were used to study the natural selection of corrective submovements. Our DPM-based model assisted in the interpretation of puzzling data from both of these experiments. We come to posit that the many loops through the basal ganglia each regulate the embodiment of pattern formation in a given area of cerebral cortex. This operation serves to instantiate different kinds of action (or thought) mediated by different areas of cerebral cortex. We then use our findings to formulate a model of the aetiology of schizophrenia.},

abstract = {The acquisition of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data in a finite subset of k-space produces ring-artifacts and 'side lobes' that distort the image. In this article, we explore the consequences of this problem for functional imaging studies, which can be considerable, and propose a solution. The truncation of k-space is mathematically equivalent to convolving the underlying "true" image with a sinc function whose width is inversely related to the amount of truncation. Spatial smoothing with a large enough kernel can eliminate these artifacts, but at a cost in image resolution. However, too little spatial smoothing leaves the ringing artifacts and side lobes caused by k-space truncation intact, leading to a potential decrease in signal-to-noise ratio and statistical power. Thus, to make use of the high-resolution afforded by MRI without introducing artifacts, new smoothing filters are needed that are optimized to correct k-space truncation-related artifacts. We develop a prolate spheroidal wave function (PSWF) filter designed to eliminate truncation artifacts and compare its performance to the standard Gaussian filter in simulations and analysis of fMRI data on a visual-motor task. The PSWF filter effectively corrected truncation artifacts and resulted in more sensitive detection of visual-motor activity in expected brain regions, demonstrating its efficacy.},

abstract = {Learning and memory and navigation literatures emphasize interactions between multiple memory systems: a flexible, planning-based system and a rigid, cached-value system. This has profound implications for decision-making. Recent conceptualizations of flexible decision-making employ prospection and projection arising from a network involving the hippocampus. Recent recordings from rodent hippocampus in decision-making situations have found transient forward-shifted representations. Evaluation of that prediction and subsequent action-selection probably occurs downstream (e.g. in orbitofrontal cortex, in ventral and dorsomedial striatum). Classically, striatum has been identified as a crucial component of the less-flexible, incremental system. Current evidence, however, suggests that striatum is involved in both flexible and stimulus-response decision-making, with dorsolateral striatum involved in stimulus-response strategies and ventral and dorsomedial striatum involved in goal-directed strategies.},

title = {Sparseness Constrains the Prolongation of Memory Lifetime via Synaptic Metaplasticity},
abstract = {Synaptic changes impair previously acquired memory traces. The smaller this impairment the larger is the longevity of memories. Two strategies have been suggested to keep memories from being overwritten too rapidly while preserving receptiveness to new contents: either introducing synaptic meta levels that store the history of synaptic state changes or reducing the number of synchronously active neurons, which decreases interference. We find that synaptic metaplasticity indeed can prolong memory lifetimes but only under the restriction that the neuronal population code is not too sparse. For sparse codes, metaplasticity may actually hinder memory longevity. This is important because in memory-related brain regions as the hippocampus population codes are sparse. Comparing 2 different synaptic cascade models with binary weights, we find that a serial topology of synaptic state transitions gives rise to larger memory capacities than a model with cross transitions. For the serial model, memory capacity is virtually independent of network size and connectivity.},

abstract = {In the temporal difference model of primate dopamine neurons, their phasic activity reports a prediction error for future reward. This model is supported by a wealth of experimental data. However, in certain circumstances, the activity of the dopamine cells seems anomalous under the model, as they respond in particular ways to stimuli that are not obviously related to predictions of reward. In this paper, we address two important sets of anomalies, those having to do with generalization and novelty. Generalization responses are treated as the natural consequence of partial information; novelty responses are treated by the suggestion that dopamine cells multiplex information about reward bonuses, including exploration bonuses and shaping bonuses. We interpret this additional role for dopamine in terms of the mechanistic attentional and psychomotor effects of dopamine, having the computational role of guiding exploration.

For this, we apply a recently introduced regularized regression technique, the Elastic Net, to the analysis of the PBAIC 2007 competition data. Elastic Net regression controls via one parameter the number of voxels in the resulting model, and via another the degree to which correlated voxels are included. We find that this method produces highly predictive models of fMRI data that provide evidence for the distributed nature of neural function. We also use the flexibility of Elastic Net to demonstrate that model robustness can be improved without compromising predictability, in turn revealing the importance of localized clusters of activity. Our findings highlight the functional significance of patterns of distributed clusters of localized activity, and underscore the importance of models that are both predictive and interpretable.},

abstract = {An event-related fMRI technique was used to assess neural responses to financial reward and penalty during a simple gambling task. We attempted to determine whether brain activities are dependent on the unique context of an event sequence. Thirty-six healthy volunteers participated in the study. The task was to guess the color of the suit of a card on each trial and to respond by pressing a button. Every correct response ("win") and incorrect response ("loss") was associated with financial reward and penalty, respectively. The magnitude of reward or penalty in each trial did not change; however, the subjects' self-reported emotional arousal was significantly higher for the events of "the fourth win of four wins in a row" and "the fourth loss of four losses in a row." We also found that the bilateral anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortices were specifically activated when the subjects experienced "the fourth win of four wins in a row" and "the fourth loss of four losses in a row." When the subjects experienced "a win following four losses in a row" or "a loss following four wins in a row," the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was specifically activated. Our data indicate that there exist brain activities associated with the event-sequence context in which abstract reward or penalty is received. These context-dependent activities appear to be crucial for adapting oneself to new circumstances and may account for clinical symptoms of various mental illnesses in which dysfunction of these regions has been reported.},

Caffeine-induced arousal was not affected in rats when A(2A)Rs were focally removed from the NAc core or other A(2A)R-positive areas of the basal ganglia.

We demonstrate transfer to a 3-back test of working memory after 5 weeks of training in updating. The transfer effect was based on a joint training-related activity increase for the criterion (letter memory) and transfer tasks in a striatal region that also was recruited pretraining. No transfer was observed to a task that did not engage updating and striatal regions, and age-related striatal changes imposed constraints on transfer. These findings indicate that transfer can occur if the criterion and transfer tasks engage specific overlapping processing components and brain regions.},

By stdying "updating" using the n-back and another (LM) in both healthy young and healthy old (which have been shown to have striatal changes) Dahlin et al hoped to test the hyptothesis that transfer is due to overlapping neural repressentations.

Key finding:  old saw no sig transfer, and no sig str activation.

However the older population had less cortical activation (medial frontal, pariatal) and had about half the mean recall (across the 5 week training).

Commom areas were lit up for young, n-back versus LM.  

What is the alternate hypothesis, no neural overlap but X? wtf?

Stroop (an odd control) showed no str activation, and no transfer.  However stroop is a very different task, so whether this is really any evidence at all is unclear to me (I tend to think it is not relelvant)

They do conclude that more is required than "overlapping neural systems" for transfer (stroop also saw limited acitvation of frontal and pariatal.

I had a better experiment in midn when we first discussed this paper, but cannot now recall it.

From Alana: previous transfer research has implicated the striatum....

This is not science worthy.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prediction error (PE) hypothesized by the temporal difference model has been shown to correlate with the phasic activity of dopamine neurons during reward learning and the blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response during reward and aversive conditioning tasks. We hypothesized that dopamine would modulate the PE related signal in aversive conditioning and that haloperidol would reduce PE related activity, while an acute dose of amphetamine would increase PE related activity in the ventral striatum. METHODS: Healthy participants took an acute dose of amphetamine, haloperidol, or placebo. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the BOLD signal while they carried out an aversive conditioning task, using cutaneous electrical stimulation as the unconditioned stimulus (US) and yellow and blue circles as conditioned stimulus (CS+ and CS-, respectively). RESULTS: Prediction error related BOLD activity was seen only in the ventral striatum in the placebo subjects. The subjects given amphetamine showed a wider network of PE related BOLD activity, including the ventral striatum, globus pallidus, putamen, insula, anterior cingulate, and substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area. Haloperidol subjects did not show PE related activity in any of these regions. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide the first demonstration that the modulation of dopamine transmission affects both the physiological correlates and PE related BOLD activity during aversive learning.},

title = {Decoding different roles for vmPFC and dlPFC in multi-attribute decision making},
abstract = {In everyday life, successful decision making requires precise representations of expected values. However, for most behavioral options more than one attribute can be relevant in order to predict the expected reward. Thus, to make good or even optimal choices the reward predictions of multiple attributes need to be integrated into a combined expected value. Importantly, the individual attributes of such multi-attribute objects can agree or disagree in their reward prediction. Here we address where the brain encodes the combined reward prediction (averaged across attributes) and where it encodes the variability of the value predictions of the individual attributes. We acquired fMRI data while subjects performed a task in which they had to integrate reward predictions from multiple attributes into a combined value. Using time-resolved pattern recognition techniques (support vector regression) we find that (1) the combined value is encoded in distributed fMRI patterns in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and that (2) the variability of value predictions of the individual attributes is encoded in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). The combined value could be used to guide choices, whereas the variability of the value predictions of individual attributes indicates an ambiguity that results in an increased difficulty of the value-integration. These results demonstrate that the different features defining multi-attribute objects are encoded in non-overlapping brain regions and therefore suggest different roles for vmPFC and dlPFC in multi-attribute decision making.},

title = {Uncertainty-based competition between prefrontal and dorsolateral striatal systems for behavioral control},
abstract = {A broad range of neural and behavioral data suggests that the brain contains multiple systems for behavioral choice, including one associated with prefrontal cortex and another with dorsolateral striatum. However, such a surfeit of control raises an additional choice problem: how to arbitrate between the systems when they disagree. Here, we consider dual-action choice systems from a normative perspective, using the computational theory of reinforcement learning. We identify a key trade-off pitting computational simplicity against the flexible and statistically efficient use of experience. The trade-off is realized in a competition between the dorsolateral striatal and prefrontal systems. We suggest a Bayesian principle of arbitration between them according to uncertainty, so each controller is deployed when it should be most accurate. This provides a unifying account of a wealth of experimental evidence about the factors favoring dominance by either system.},

abstract = {The phasic firing of dopamine neurons has been theorized to encode a reward-prediction error as formalized by the temporal-difference (TD) algorithm in reinforcement learning. Most TD models of dopamine have assumed a stimulus representation, known as the complete serial compound, in which each moment in a trial is distinctly represented. We introduce a more realistic temporal stimulus representation for the TD model. In our model, all external stimuli, including rewards, spawn a series of internal microstimuli, which grow weaker and more diffuse over time. These microstimuli are used by the TD learning algorithm to generate predictions of future reward. This new stimulus representation injects temporal generalization into the TD model and enhances correspondence between model and data in several experiments, including those when rewards are omitted or received early. This improved fit mostly derives from the absence of large negative errors in the new model, suggesting that dopamine alone can encode the ...},

abstract = {Motivation improves the efficiency of intentional behavior, but how this performance modulation is instantiated in the human brain remains unclear. We used a reward-cued antisaccade paradigm to investigate how motivational goals (the expectation of a reward for good performance) modulate patterns of neural activation and functional connectivity to improve preparation for antisaccade performance. Behaviorally, subjects performed better (faster and more accurate antisaccades) when they knew they would be rewarded for good performance. Reward anticipation was associated with increased activation in the ventral and dorsal striatum, and cortical oculomotor regions. Functional connectivity between the caudate nucleus and cortical oculomotor control structures predicted individual differences in the behavioral benefit of reward anticipation. We conclude that although both dorsal and ventral striatal circuitry are involved in the anticipation of reward, only the dorsal striatum and its connected cortical network is involved in the direct modulation of oculomotor behavior by motivational incentive.},

abstract = {Motivation is a complex process that leads to completion or avoidance of a behavior. Past research strongly implicates the basal ganglia in a circuit integral for the control of motivation. Specifically, the human striatum has been shown to process reward information, differentiating between monetary rewards and punishments in recent neuroimaging experiments. It is unclear, however, how the dorsal striatum, particularly the caudate nucleus, responds to changes in the motivational context of a task. Using an event-related design, where participants were given positive and negative feedback upon guessing the value of an unknown card, we manipulated the motivational context of the task by dividing trials into periods of high incentive (where visual feedback indicated monetary rewards and punishments) and low incentive (where visual feedback indicated only accuracy). We found that activity in the caudate nucleus was strongly influenced by the different incentive periods. The hemodynamic response was characterized by a larger rise at the onset of trials and larger differences between positive and negative feedback during periods of high incentive. These results suggest that changes in motivation are capable of modulating basal ganglia activity, and further support an important role for the caudate nucleus in affective processing.},

abstract = {An intact mesocortical dopaminergic (DA) input to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been reported to be necessary for long-term potentiation (LTP) to occur at hippocampal-prefrontal cortex synapses. Here, we investigated the role of D1 and D2 receptors in this NMDA receptor-dependent LTP. Local infusion of the D1 agonist SKF81297 at an optimal dose induced a sustained enhancement of hippocampal-PFC LTP, whereas the D1 antagonist SCH23390 caused a dose-related impairment of its induction. The D1 agonist effect was mimicked by infusion of a low dose of the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin, whereas LTP was severely attenuated with a protein kinase A inhibitor, Rp-cAMPS. To further assess the complex interplay between DA and NMDA receptors, changes in extracellular DA levels in the PFC were estimated during LTP, and a significant increase was observed immediately after tetanus. Taken together, these data suggest that D1 but not D2 receptors are crucial for the DA control of the NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic response on a specific excitatory input to the PFC. The interactions of these receptors may play a crucial role in the storage and transfer of hippocampal information in the PFC.},

In the context of motor function, these interconnections can be understood as disinhibiting, or "releasing the brakes," on frontal motor action plans: The basal ganglia detect appropriate contexts for performing motor actions and enable the frontal cortex to execute such actions at the appropriate time. We build on this idea in the domain of working memory through the use of computational neural network models of this circuit. In our model, the frontal cortex exhibits robust active maintenance, whereas the basal ganglia contribute a selective, dynamic gating function that enables frontal memory representations to be rapidly updated in a task-relevant manner. We apply the model to a novel version of the continuous performance task that requires subroutine-like selective working memory updating and compare and contrast our model with other existing models and theories of frontal-cortex-basal-ganglia interactions.},

A statistical account can offer a new, principled interpretation of behavior, and previous experiments and theories can inform many unexplored aspects of the Bayesian enterprise. Here we consider one such issue: the finding that surprising events provoke animals to learn faster. We suggest that, in a statistical account of conditioning, surprise signals change and therefore uncertainty and the need for new learning. We discuss inference in a world that changes and show how experimental results involving surprise can be interpreted from this perspective, and also how, thus understood, these phenomena help constrain statistical theories of animal and human learning.},

title = {Coding visual images of objects in the inferotemporal cortex of the macaque monkey},
abstract = {1. The inferotemporal cortex (IT) has been thought to play an essential and specific role in visual object discrimination and recognition, because a lesion of IT in the monkey results in a specific deficit in learning tasks that require these visual functions. To understand the cellular basis of the object discrimination and recognition processes in IT, we determined the optimal stimulus of individual IT cells in anesthetized, immobilized monkeys. 2. In the posterior one-third or one-fourth of IT, most cells could be activated maximally by bars or disks just by adjusting the size, orientation, or color of the stimulus. 3. In the remaining anterior two-thirds or three-quarters of IT, most cells required more complex features for their maximal activation. 4. The critical feature for the activation of individual anterior IT cells varied from cell to cell: a complex shape in some cells and a combination of texture or color with contour-shape in other cells. 5. Cells that showed different types of complexity for the critical feature were intermingled throughout anterior IT, whereas cells recorded in single penetrations showed critical features that were related in some respects. 6. Generally speaking, the critical features of anterior IT cells were moderately complex and can be thought of as partial features common to images of several different natural objects. The selectivity to the optimal stimulus was rather sharp, although not absolute. We thus propose that, in anterior IT, images of objects are coded by combinations of active cells, each of which represents the presence of a particular partial feature in the image.},

In linear hard margin SVMs the feture space (z) is the input space (x).  The decision function (D) is the hyperplane and is given by

D(z) = w*z + w = {1,-1}

w defines the decision boundry.

In the soft margin and error term (E) is introduced 

D(z) = w*z + w = {1-E,  -1(1-E)}

Support vectors (e > 0) are those feature vectors that are most difficult to classify, they are the least distinct.

"Even though the development of the SVM was motivated purely by the predictive learning problem, general work in interpretation has been done by several researchers, including Smola (Smola et al., 1998) and Kwok (Kwok, 1999; Kwok, 2000) to integrate SVM into a Bayesian framework.

abstract = {Dopamine shapes a wide variety of psychomotor functions. This is mainly accomplished by modulating cortical and thalamic glutamatergic signals impinging upon principal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the striatum. Several lines of evidence suggest that dopamine D1 receptor signaling enhances dendritic excitability and glutamatergic signaling in striatonigral MSNs, whereas D2 receptor signaling exerts the opposite effect in striatopallidal MSNs. The functional antagonism between these two major striatal dopamine receptors extends to the regulation of synaptic plasticity. Recent studies, using transgenic mice in which cells express D1 and D2 receptors, have uncovered unappreciated differences between MSNs that shape glutamatergic signaling and the influence of DA on synaptic plasticity. These studies have also shown that long-term alterations in dopamine signaling produce profound and cell-type-specific reshaping of corticostriatal connectivity and function.},

abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated that spatial patterns of fMRI BOLD activity distribution over the brain may be used to classify different groups or mental states. These studies are based on the application of advanced pattern recognition approaches and multivariate statistical classifiers. Most published articles in this field are focused on improving the accuracy rates and many approaches have been proposed to accomplish this task. Nevertheless, a point inherent to most machine learning methods (and still relatively unexplored in neuroimaging) is how the discriminative information can be used to characterize groups and their differences. In this work, we introduce the Maximum Uncertainty Linear Discrimination Analysis (MLDA) and show how it can be applied to infer groups' patterns by discriminant hyperplane navigation. In addition, we show that it naturally defines a behavioral score, i.e., an index quantifying the distance between the states of a subject from predefined groups. We validate and illustrate this approach using a motor block design fMRI experiment data with 35 subjects.},

title = {Analysis of fMRI data by blind separation into independent spatial components},
abstract = {Current analytical techniques applied to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data require a priori knowledge or specific assumptions about the time courses of processes contributing to the measured signals. Here we describe a new method for analyzing fMRI data based on the independent component analysis (ICA) algorithm of Bell and Sejnowski ([1995]: Neural Comput 7:1129-1159). We decomposed eight fMRI data sets from 4 normal subjects performing Stroop color-naming, the Brown and Peterson work/number task, and control tasks into spatially independent components. Each component consisted of voxel values at fixed three-dimensional locations (a component "map"), and a unique associated time course of activation. Given data from 144 time points collected during a 6-min trial, ICA extracted an equal number of spatially independent components. In all eight trials, ICA derived one and only one component with a time course closely matching the time course of 40-sec alternations between experimental and control tasks. The regions of maximum activity in these consistently task-related components generally overlapped active regions detected by standard correlational analysis, but included frontal regions not detected by correlation. Time courses of other ICA components were transiently task-related, quasiperiodic, or slowly varying. By utilizing higher-order statistics to enforce successively stricter criteria for spatial independence between component maps, both the ICA algorithm and a related fourth-order decomposition technique (Comon [1994]: Signal Processing 36:11-20) were superior to principal component analysis (PCA) in determining the spatial and temporal extent of task-related activation. For each subject, the time courses and active regions of the task-related ICA components were consistent across trials and were robust to the addition of simulated noise. Simulated movement artifact and simulated task-related activations added to actual fMRI data were clearly separated by the algorithm. ICA can be used to distinguish between nontask-related signal components, movements, and other artifacts, as well as consistently or transiently task-related fMRI activations, based on only weak assumptions about their spatial distributions and without a priori assumptions about their time courses. ICA appears to be a highly promising method for the analysis of fMRI data from normal and clinical populations, especially for uncovering unpredictable transient patterns of brain activity associated with performance of psychomotor tasks.},

We recorded responses of single neurons during performance of a choice task that provided information about the reward values of options that were not chosen. We found that ACC neurons signal fictive reward information and use a coding scheme similar to that used to signal experienced outcomes. Thus, individual ACC neurons process both experienced and fictive rewards.},

We used these clusters to divide the frontal areas into 5 groups, including ventral-lateral, ventral-medial, dorsal-medial, dorsal-lateral, and caudal-orbital groups. Each of these groups was defined by a unique set of inputs. This organization provides insight into the differential roles of each group of areas and suggests a gradient by which orbital and ventral-medial areas may be responsible for decision-making processes based on emotion and primary reinforcers, and lateral frontal areas are more involved in integrating affective and rational information into a common framework.},

These ``brain-reading'' analyses advance functional neuroimaging on three fronts. From a technical standpoint, pattern-based classifiers overcome fatal f laws in the status quo inferential and exploratory multivariate approaches by combining pattern-based analyses with a direct link to experimental variables. In theoretical terms, the results that emerge from pattern-based classifiers can offer insight into the nature of neural representations. This shifts the emphasis in functional neuroimaging studies away from localizing brain activity toward understanding how patterns of brain activity encode information. From a practical point of view, pattern-based classifiers are already well established and understood in many areas of cognitive science.

abstract = {Critical to our many daily choices between larger delayed rewards, and smaller more immediate rewards, are the shape and the steepness of the function that discounts rewards with time. Although research in artificial intelligence favors exponential discounting in uncertain environments, studies with humans and animals have consistently shown hyperbolic discounting. We investigated how humans perform in a reward decision task with temporal constraints, in which each choice affects the time remaining for later trials, and in which the delays vary at each trial. We demonstrated that most of our subjects adopted exponential discounting in this experiment. Further, we confirmed analytically that exponential discounting, with a decay rate comparable to that used by our subjects, maximized the total reward gain in our task. Our results suggest that the particular shape and steepness of temporal discounting is determined by the task that the subject is facing, and question the notion of hyperbolic reward discounting as a universal principle.},

title = {Estimation and detection of event-related fMRI signals with temporally correlated noise: a statistically efficient and unbiased approach},
abstract = {Recent developments in analysis methods for event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has enabled a wide range of novel experimental designs. As with selective averaging methods used in event-related potential (ERP) research, these methods allow for the estimation of the average time-locked response to particular event-types, even when these events occur in rapid succession and in an arbitrary sequence. Here we present a flexible framework for obtaining efficient and unbiased estimates of event-related hemodynamic responses, in the presence of realistic temporally correlated (nonwhite) noise. We further present statistical inference methods based upon the estimated responses, using restriction matrices to formulate temporal hypothesis tests about the shape of the evoked responses. The accuracy of the methods is assessed using synthetic noise, actual fMRI noise, and synthetic activation in actual noise. Actual false-positive rates were compared to nominal false-positive rates assuming white noise, as well as local and global noise estimates in the estimation procedure (assuming white noise resulted in inappropriate inference, while both global and local estimates corrected false-positive rates). Furthermore, both local and global noise estimates were found to increase the statistical power of the hypothesis tests, as measured by the receiver operating characteristics (ROC). This approach thus enables appropriate univariate statistical inference with improved statistical power, without requiring a priori assumptions about the shape or timing of the event-related hemodynamic response.},

abstract = {The Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) has been extensively studied from the genetic and biochemical point of view. The main characteristic of the syndrome is the self-mutilation feature, which has been poorly studied and understood. We propose a new hypothesis about the self-mutilation physiopathology, which is related to the supersensitivity of the dopaminergic D1 receptors in the neuromatrix found in the cingulum cortex region. The LNS shows an increase of uric acid levels as a result of the deficiency of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase enzyme. This increase could induce damage to dopaminergic neurons. As a consequence, a decrease in dopamine synthesis during gestation and the early postnatal period could occur, producing a functional dopaminergic denervation of the 131 receptors, located on the prefrontal cortex, specifically in the cingulum bundle projections. This phenomenon could induce a codification disturbance in the `genetic body' of the neuromatrix, that could be expressed functionally as anosognosia, giving rise to self-mutilation. We suggest that this self-mutilation is a pain consciousness problem.},

title = {Limbic corticostriatal systems and delayed reinforcement},
abstract = {Impulsive choice, one aspect of impulsivity, is characterized by an abnormally high preference for small, immediate rewards over larger delayed rewards, and can be a feature of adolescence, but also attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), addiction, and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Both the serotonin and dopamine neuromodulator systems are implicated in impulsivity; manipulations of these systems affect animal models of impulsive choice, though these effects may depend on the receptor subtype and whether or not the reward is signaled. These systems project to limbic cortical and striatal structures shown to be abnormal in animal models of ADHD. Damage to the nucleus accumbens core (AcbC) causes rats to exhibit impulsive choice. These rats are also hyperactive, but are unimpaired in tests of visuospatial attention; they may therefore represent an animal model of the hyperactive-impulsive subtype of ADHD. Lesions to the anterior cingulate or medial prefrontal cortex, two afferents to the AcbC, do not induce impulsive choice, but lesions of the basolateral amygdala do, while lesions to the orbitofrontal cortex have had opposite effects in different tasks measuring impulsive choice. In theory, impulsive choice may emerge as a result of abnormal processing of the magnitude of rewards, or as a result of a deficit in the effects of delayed reinforcement. Recent evidence suggests that AcbC-lesioned rats perceive reward magnitude normally, but exhibit a selective deficit in learning instrumental responses using delayed reinforcement, suggesting that the AcbC is a reinforcement learning system that mediates the effects of delayed rewards.},

In the present study, we investigated whether hippocampal synaptic plasticity, as measured by long-term potentiation (UP), might also vary across the estrous cycle of the female rat. Male rats, and female rats at each phase of the estrous cycle were tested in either the morning or afternoon. There were no significant group differences in the pre-LTP I/O curves. However, females examined during the afternoon of proestrus, the phase during which prior studies indicate synapse number to be highest, demonstrated the greatest degree of potentiation. Diestrus, proestrus and estrus females tested in the morning demonstrated similar amounts of potentiation. There were also significant differences in post-LTP I/O curves between the afternoon proestrus females and males tested in the afternoon. These results suggest that gonadal hormones, interacting with the time of day, may regulate neural processes underlying learning and memory.},

abstract = {We present a framework aimed to reveal directed interactions of activated brain areas using time-resolved fMRI and vector autoregressive (VAR) modeling in the context of Granger causality. After describing the underlying mathematical concepts, we present simulations helping to characterize the conditions under which VAR modeling and Granger causality can reveal directed interactions from fluctuations in BOLD-like signal time courses. We apply the proposed approach to a dynamic sensorimotor mapping paradigm. In an event-related fMRI experiment, subjects performed a visuomotor mapping task for which the mapping of two stimuli ("faces" vs "houses") to two responses ("left" or "right") alternated periodically between the two possible mappings. Besides expected activity in sensory and motor areas, a fronto-parietal network was found to be active during presentation of a cue indicating a change in the stimulus-response (S-R) mapping. The observed network includes the superior parietal lobule and premotor areas. These areas might be involved in setting up and maintaining stimulus-response associations. The Granger causality analysis revealed a directed influence exerted by the left lateral prefrontal cortex and premotor areas on the left posterior parietal cortex.},

title = {Dissociable systems for gain- and loss-related value predictions and errors of prediction in the human brain},
abstract = {Midbrain dopaminergic neurons projecting to the ventral striatum code for reward magnitude and probability during reward anticipation and then indicate the difference between actual and predicted outcome. It has been questioned whether such a common system for the prediction and evaluation of reward exists in humans. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a guessing task in two large cohorts, we are able to confirm ventral striatal responses coding both reward probability and magnitude during anticipation, permitting the local computation of expected value (EV). However, the ventral striatum only represented the gain-related part of EV (EV+). At reward delivery, the same area shows a reward probability and magnitude-dependent prediction error signal, best modeled as the difference between actual outcome and EV+. In contrast, loss-related expected value (EV-) and the associated prediction error was represented in the amygdala. Thus, the ventral striatum and the amygdala distinctively process the value of a prediction and subsequently compute a prediction error for gains and losses, respectively. Therefore, a homeostatic balance of both systems might be important for generating adequate expectations under uncertainty. Prevalence of either part might render expectations more positive or negative, which could contribute to the pathophysiology of mood disorders like major depression.},

title = {Modifications of reward expectation-related neuronal activity during learning in primate orbitofrontal cortex},
abstract = {This study investigated how neuronal activity in orbitofrontal cortex related to the expectation of reward changed while monkeys repeatedly learned to associate new instruction pictures with known behavioral reactions and reinforcers. In a delayed go-nogo task with several trial types, an initial picture instructed the animal to execute or withhold a reaching movement and to expect a liquid reward or a conditioned auditory reinforcer. When novel instruction pictures were presented, animals learned according to a trial-and-error strategy. After experience with a large number of novel pictures, learning occurred in a few trials, and correct performance usually exceeded 70% in the first 60-90 trials. About 150 task-related neurons in orbitofrontal cortex were studied in both familiar and learning conditions and showed two major forms of changes during learning. Quantitative changes of responses to the initial instruction were seen as appearance of new responses, increase of existing responses, or decrease or complete disappearance of responses. The changes usually outlasted initial learning trials and persisted during subsequent consolidation. They often modified the trial selectivities of activations. Increases might reflect the increased attention during learning and induce neuronal changes underlying the behavioral adaptations. Decreases might be related to the unreliable reward-predicting value of frequently changing learning instructions. The second form of changes reflected the adaptation of reward expectations during learning. In initial learning trials, animals reacted as if they expected liquid reward in every trial type, although only two of the three trial types were rewarded with liquid. In close correspondence, neuronal activations related to the expectation of reward occurred initially in every trial type. The behavioral indices for reward expectation and their neuronal correlates adapted in parallel during the course of learning and became restricted to rewarded trials. In conclusion, these data support the notion that neurons in orbitofrontal cortex code reward information in a flexible and adaptive manner during behavioral changes after novel stimuli.},

Moreover, in these areas, we found a correlation between the magnitude of the brain activation and the magnitude of the rewards and punishments received.

Neural correlates of associative learning have been observed in both brain regions, but whether or not these regions have unique functions is unclear, as they have typically been studied separately using different tasks. Here we show that during associative learning in monkeys, neural activity in these areas changes at different rates: the striatum (an input structure of the basal ganglia) showed rapid, almost bistable, changes compared with a slower trend in the prefrontal cortex that was more in accordance with slow improvements in behavioural performance. Also, pre-saccadic activity began progressively earlier in the striatum but not in the prefrontal cortex as learning took place. These results support the hypothesis that rewarded associations are first identified by the basal ganglia, the output of which 'trains' slower learning mechanisms in the frontal cortex.},

title = {Reward-related activity in the human motor cortex},
abstract = {The human primary motor cortex (M1) participates in motor learning and response selection, functions that rely on feedback on the success of behavior (i.e. reward). To investigate the possibility that behavioral contingencies alter M1 activity in humans, we tested intracortical inhibition with single and paired (subthreshold/suprathreshold) transcranial magnetic stimulation during a slot machine simulation that delivered variable money rewards for three-way matches and required no movement. A two-way match before the third barrel had stopped (increased reward expectation) was associated with more paired-pulse inhibition than no match. Receiving a large reward on the preceding trial augmented this effect. A control task that manipulated attention to the same stimuli produced no changes in excitability. The origin of this reward-related activity is not clear, although dopaminergic ventral tegmental area neurons project to M1, where they are thought to inhibit output neurons and could be the source of the finding. Transcranial magnetic stimulation of M1 may be useful as a quantitative measure of reward-related activity.},

title = {Modeling the violation of reward maximization and invariance in reinforcement schedules},
abstract = {It is often assumed that animals and people adjust their behavior to maximize reward acquisition. In visually cued reinforcement schedules, monkeys make errors in trials that are not immediately rewarded, despite having to repeat error trials. Here we show that error rates are typically smaller in trials equally distant from reward but belonging to longer schedules (referred to as "schedule length effect"). This violates the principles of reward maximization and invariance and cannot be predicted by the standard methods of Reinforcement Learning, such as the method of temporal differences. We develop a heuristic model that accounts for all of the properties of the behavior in the reinforcement schedule task but whose predictions are not different from those of the standard temporal difference model in choice tasks. In the modification of temporal difference learning introduced here, the effect of schedule length emerges spontaneously from the sensitivity to the immediately preceding trial. We also introduce a policy for general Markov Decision Processes, where the decision made at each node is conditioned on the motivation to perform an instrumental action, and show that the application of our model to the reinforcement schedule task and the choice task are special cases of this general theoretical framework. Within this framework, Reinforcement Learning can approach contextual learning with the mixture of empirical findings and principled assumptions that seem to coexist in the best descriptions of animal behavior. As examples, we discuss two phenomena observed in humans that often derive from the violation of the principle of invariance: "framing," wherein equivalent options are treated differently depending on the context in which they are presented, and the "sunk cost" effect, the greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment in money, effort, or time has been made. The schedule length effect might be a manifestation of these phenomena in monkeys.},

Calculations based on the model show pronounced transients in the deoxyhemoglobin content and the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal measured with functional MRI, including initial dips and overshoots and a prolonged poststimulus undershoot of the BOLD signal. Furthermore, these transient effects can occur in the presence of tight coupling of cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism throughout the activation period. An initial test of the model against experimental measurements of flow and BOLD changes during a finger-tapping task showed good agreement.},

title = {Hierarchically organized behavior and its neural foundations: A reinforcement learning perspective},
abstract = {Research on human and animal behavior has long emphasized its hierarchical structure-the divisibility of ongoing behavior into discrete tasks, which are comprised of subtask sequences, which in turn are built of simple actions. The hierarchical structure of behavior has also been of enduring interest within neuroscience, where it has been widely considered to reflect prefrontal cortical functions. In this paper, we reexamine behavioral hierarchy and its neural substrates from the point of view of recent developments in computational reinforcement learning. Specifically, we consider a set of approaches known collectively as hierarchical reinforcement learning, which extend the reinforcement learning paradigm by allowing the learning agent to aggregate actions into reusable subroutines or skills. A close look at the components of hierarchical reinforcement learning suggests how they might map onto neural structures, in particular regions within the dorsolateral and orbital prefrontal cortex. It also suggests specific ways in which hierarchical reinforcement learning might provide a complement to existing psychological models of hierarchically structured behavior. A particularly important question that hierarchical reinforcement learning brings to the fore is that of how learning identifies new action routines that are likely to provide useful building blocks in solving a wide range of future problems. Here and at many other points, hierarchical reinforcement learning offers an appealing framework for investigating the computational and neural underpinnings of hierarchically structured behavior.},

abstract = {Central serotonin (5-HT) has been implicated in emotional and behavioral control processes for many decades, but its precise contribution is not well understood. We used the acute tryptophan depletion procedure in young healthy volunteers to test the hypothesis that central 5-HT is critical for predicting punishment. An observational reversal-learning task was employed that provided separate measures of punishment and reward prediction. Under baseline, subjects made more prediction errors for punishment-associated stimuli than for reward-associated stimuli. This bias was abolished after central 5-HT depletion, which enhanced the ability to predict punishment while not affecting reward prediction. The selective potentiation of punishment prediction concurs with recent theorizing, suggesting that central 5-HT carries a prediction error for future punishment, but not for future reward (Daw et al, 2002). Furthermore, the finding highlights the importance of central 5-HT in resilience to adversity and may have implications for a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including depression and anxiety.},

title = {Dopamine: generalization and bonuses},
abstract = {In the temporal difference model of primate dopamine neurons, their phasic activity reports a prediction error for future reward. This model is supported by a wealth of experimental data. However, in certain circumstances, the activity of the dopamine cells seems anomalous under the model, as they respond in particular ways to stimuli that are not obviously related to predictions of reward. In this paper, we address two important sets of anomalies, those having to do with generalization and novelty. Generalization responses are treated as the natural consequence of partial information; novelty responses are treated by the suggestion that dopamine cells multiplex information about reward bonuses, including exploration bonuses and shaping bonuses. We interpret this additional role for dopamine in terms of the mechanistic attentional and psychomotor effects of dopamine, having the computational role of guiding exploration.

title = {Identifying natural images from human brain activity},
abstract = {A challenging goal in neuroscience is to be able to read out, or decode, mental content from brain activity. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have decoded orientation, position and object category from activity in visual cortex. However, these studies typically used relatively simple stimuli (for example, gratings) or images drawn from fixed categories (for example, faces, houses), and decoding was based on previous measurements of brain activity evoked by those same stimuli or categories. To overcome these limitations, here we develop a decoding method based on quantitative receptive-field models that characterize the relationship between visual stimuli and fMRI activity in early visual areas. These models describe the tuning of individual voxels for space, orientation and spatial frequency, and are estimated directly from responses evoked by natural images. We show that these receptive-field models make it possible to identify, from a large set of completely novel natural images, which specific image was seen by an observer. Identification is not a mere consequence of the retinotopic organization of visual areas; simpler receptive-field models that describe only spatial tuning yield much poorer identification performance. Our results suggest that it may soon be possible to reconstruct a picture of a person's visual experience from measurements of brain activity alone.},

title = {Differential involvement of neurons in the dorsal and ventral premotor cortex during processing of visual signals for action planning},
abstract = {We examined neuronal activity in the dorsal and ventral premotor cortex (PMd and PMv, respectively) to explore the role of each motor area in processing visual signals for action planning. We recorded neuronal activity while monkeys performed a behavioral task during which two visual instruction cues were given successively with an intervening delay. One cue instructed the location of the target to be reached, and the other indicated which arm was to be used. We found that the properties of neuronal activity in the PMd and PMv differed in many respects. After the first cue was given, PMv neuron response mostly reflected the spatial position of the visual cue. In contrast, PMd neuron response also reflected what the visual cue instructed, such as which arm to be used or which target to be reached. After the second cue was given, PMv neurons initially responded to the cue's visuospatial features and later reflected what the two visual cues instructed, progressively increasing information about the target location. In contrast, the activity of the majority of PMd neurons responded to the second cue with activity reflecting a combination of information supplied by the first and second cues. Such activity, already reflecting a forthcoming action, appeared with short latencies (<400 ms) and persisted throughout the delay period. In addition, both the PMv and PMd showed bilateral representation on visuospatial information and motor-target or effector information. These results further elucidate the functional specialization of the PMd and PMv during the processing of visual information for action planning.},

title = {Dissociation of reward anticipation and outcome with event-related fMRI},
abstract = {Reward processing involves both appetitive and consummatory phases. We sought to examine whether reward anticipation vs outcomes would recruit different regions of ventral forebrain circuitry using event-related fMRI. Nine healthy volunteers participated in a monetary incentive delays task in which they either responded to a cued target for monetary reward, responded to a cued target for no reward, or did not respond to a cued target during scanning. Multiple regression analyses indicated that while anticipation of reward vs non-reward activated foci in the ventral striatum, reward vs non-reward outcomes activated foci in the ventromedial frontal cortex. These findings suggest that reward anticipation and outcomes may differentially recruit distinct regions that lie along the trajectory of ascending dopamine projections.},

title = {Optimal approximation of signal priors},
abstract = {In signal restoration by Bayesian inference, one typically uses a parametric model of the prior distribution of the signal. Here, we consider how the parameters of a prior model should be estimated from observations of uncorrupted signals. A lot of recent work has implicitly assumed that maximum likelihood estimation is the optimal estimation method. Our results imply that this is not the case. We first obtain an objective function that approximates the error occurred in signal restoration due to an imperfect prior model. Next, we show that in an important special case (small gaussian noise), the error is the same as the score-matching objective function, which was previously proposed as an alternative for likelihood based on purely computational considerations. Our analysis thus shows that score matching combines computational simplicity with statistical optimality in signal restoration, providing a viable alternative to maximum likelihood methods. We also show how the method leads to a new intuitive and geometric interpretation of structure inherent in probability distributions.},

title = {Coherence between fMRI time-series distinguishes two spatial working memory networks},
abstract = {Widespread and distributed brain regions are thought to form networks that together support working memory. We recently demonstrated that different cortical areas maintain relatively different codes across a memory delay (Curtis et. al., J Neurosci, 2004; 24:3944-3952). The frontal eye fields (FEF), for example, were more active during the delay when the direction of the memory-guided saccade was known compared to when it was not known throughout the delay. Other areas showed the opposite pattern. Despite these task-dependent differences in regional activity, we could only assume but not address the functional interactions between the identified nodes of the putative network. Here, we use a bivariate technique, coherence, to formally characterize functional interactions between a seed region and other brain areas. We find that the type of representational codes that are being maintained in working memory biases frontal-parietal interactions. For example, coherence between FEF and other oculomotor areas was greater when a motor representation was an efficient strategy to bridge the delay period. However, coherence between the FEF and higher-order heteromodal areas, e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, was greater when a sensory representation must be maintained in working memory.},

abstract = {Neurons release neurotransmitters by calcium-dependent exocytosis of synaptic vesicles. However, the molecular steps transducing the calcium signal into membrane fusion are still an enigma. It is reported here that synaptotagmin, a highly conserved synaptic vesicle protein, binds calcium at physiological concentrations in a complex with negatively charged phospholipids. This binding is specific for calcium and involves the cytoplasmic domain of synaptotagmin. Calcium binding is dependent on the intact oligomeric structure of synaptotagmin (it is abolished by proteolytic cleavage at a single site). These results suggest that synaptotagmin acts as a cooperative calcium receptor in exocytosis.},

title = {The cognitive functions of the caudate nucleus},
abstract = {The basal ganglia as a whole are broadly responsible for sensorimotor coordination, including response selection and initiation. However, it has become increasingly clear that regions of the basal ganglia are functionally delineated along corticostriatal lines, and that a modular conception of the respective functions of various nuclei is useful. Here we examine the specific role of the caudate nucleus, and in particular, how this differs from that of the putamen. This review considers converging evidence from multiple domains including anatomical studies of corticostriatal circuitry, neuroimaging studies of healthy volunteers, patient studies of performance deficits on a variety of cognitive tests, and animal studies of behavioural control. We conclude that the caudate nucleus contributes to behaviour through the excitation of correct action schemas and the selection of appropriate sub-goals based on an evaluation of action-outcomes; both processes fundamental to successful goal-directed action. This is in contrast to the putamen, which appears to subserve cognitive functions more limited to stimulus-response, or habit, learning. This modular conception of the striatum is consistent with hierarchical models of cortico-striatal function through which adaptive behaviour towards significant goals can be identified (motivation; ventral striatum), planned (cognition; caudate) and implemented (sensorimotor coordination; putamen) effectively.},

title = {fMRI pattern classification using neuroanatomically constrained boosting},
abstract = {Pattern classification in functional MRI (fMRI) is a novel methodology to automatically identify differences in distributed neural substrates resulting from cognitive tasks. Reliable pattern classification is challenging due to the high dimensionality of fMRI data, the small number of available data sets, interindividual differences, and dependence on the acquisition methodology. Thus, most previous fMRI classification methods were applied in individual subjects. In this study, we developed a novel approach to improve multiclass classification across groups of subjects, field strengths, and fMRI methods. Spatially normalized activation maps were segmented into functional areas using a neuroanatomical atlas and each map was classified separately using local classifiers. A single multiclass output was applied using a weighted aggregation of the classifier's outputs. An Adaboost technique was applied, modified to find the optimal aggregation of a set of spatially distributed classifiers. This Adaboost combined the region-specific classifiers to achieve improved classification accuracy with respect to conventional techniques. Multiclass classification accuracy was assessed in an fMRI group study with interleaved motor, visual, auditory, and cognitive task design. Data were acquired across 18 subjects at different field strengths (1.5 T, 4 T), with different pulse sequence parameters (voxel size and readout bandwidth). Misclassification rates of the boosted classifier were between 3.5% and 10%, whereas for the single classifier, these were between 15% and 23%, suggesting that the boosted classifier provides a better generalization ability together with better robustness. The high computational speed of boosting classification makes it attractive for real-time fMRI to facilitate online interpretation of dynamically changing activation patterns.},

In an event-related FMRI experiment, we independently manipulated valence and salience by cuing participants to anticipate certain and uncertain monetary gains and losses. NAcc activation correlated with both valence and salience. On trials with certain outcomes, NAcc activation increased for anticipated gains and decreased for anticipated losses. On trials with uncertain outcomes, NAcc activation increased for both anticipated gains and losses but did not differ between them. These findings suggest that NAcc activation separately represents both valence and salience, consistent with its hypothesized role in appetitive motivation.},

title = {Multivoxel pattern analysis reveals increased memory targeting and reduced use of retrieved details during single-agenda source monitoring},
abstract = {We used multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) of functional MRI (fMRI) data to gain insight into how subjects' retrieval agendas influence source memory judgments (was item X studied using source Y?). In Experiment 1, we used a single-agenda test where subjects judged whether items were studied with the targeted source or not. In Experiment 2, we used a multiagenda test where subjects judged whether items were studied using the targeted source, studied using a different source, or nonstudied. To evaluate the differences between single- and multiagenda source monitoring, we trained a classifier to detect source-specific fMRI activity at study, and then we applied the classifier to data from the test phase. We focused on trials where the targeted source and the actual source differed, so we could use MVPA to track neural activity associated with both the targeted source and the actual source. Our results indicate that single-agenda monitoring was associated with increased focus on the targeted source (as evidenced by increased targeted-source activity, relative to baseline) and reduced use of information relating to the actual, nontarget source. In the multiagenda experiment, high levels of actual-source activity were associated with increased correct rejections, suggesting that subjects were using recollection of actual-source information to avoid source memory errors. In the single-agenda experiment, there were comparable levels of actual-source activity (suggesting that recollection was taking place), but the relationship between actual-source activity and behavior was absent (suggesting that subjects were failing to make proper use of this information).},

abstract = {Neuropsychological studies report more impaired responses to facial expressions of fear than disgust in people with amygdala lesions, and vice versa in people with Huntington's disease. Experiments using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have confirmed the role of the amygdala in the response to fearful faces and have implicated the anterior insula in the response to facial expressions of disgust. We used fMRI to extend these studies to the perception of fear and disgust from both facial and vocal expressions. Consistent with neuropsychological findings, both types of fearful stimuli activated the amygdala. Facial expressions of disgust activated the anterior insula and the caudate-putamen; vocal expressions of disgust did not significantly activate either of these regions. All four types of stimuli activated the superior temporal gyrus. Our findings therefore (i) support the differential localization of the neural substrates of fear and disgust; (ii) confirm the involvement of the amygdala in the emotion of fear, whether evoked by facial or vocal expressions; (iii) confirm the involvement of the anterior insula and the striatum in reactions to facial expressions of disgust; and (iv) suggest a possible general role for the perception of emotional expressions for the superior temporal gyrus.},

title = {Detection versus estimation in event-related fMRI: choosing the optimal stimulus timing},
abstract = {With the advent of event-related paradigms in functional MRI, there has been interest in finding the optimal stimulus timing, especially when the interstimulus interval is varied during the imaging run. Previous works have proposed stimulus timings to optimize either the estimation of the impulse response function (IRF) or the detection of signal changes. The purpose of this paper is to clarify that estimation and detection are fundamentally different goals and to determine the optimal stimulus timing and distribution with respect to both the accuracy of estimating the IRF and the power of detection assuming a particular hemodynamic model. Simulated stimulus distributions are varied systematically, from traditional blocked designs to rapidly varying event related designs. These simulations indicate that estimation of the hemodynamic impulse response function is optimized when stimuli are frequently alternated between task and control states, with shorter interstimulus intervals and stimulus durations, whereas the detection of activated areas is optimized by blocked designs. The stimulus timing for a given experiment should therefore be generated with the required detectability and estimation accuracy.},

abstract = {We introduce a data-analysis framework and performance metrics for evaluating and optimizing the interaction between activation tasks, experimental designs, and the methodological choices and tools for data acquisition, preprocessing, data analysis, and extraction of statistical parametric maps (SPMs). Our NPAIRS (nonparametric prediction, activation, influence, and reproducibility resampling) framework provides an alternative to simulations and ROC curves by using real PET and fMRI data sets to examine the relationship between prediction accuracy and the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) associated with reproducible SPMs. Using cross-validation resampling we plot training-test set predictions of the experimental design variables (e.g., brain-state labels) versus reproducibility SNR metrics for the associated SPMs. We demonstrate the utility of this framework across the wide range of performance metrics obtained from [(15)O]water PET studies of 12 age- and sex-matched data sets performing different motor tasks (8 subjects/set). For the 12 data sets we apply NPAIRS with both univariate and multivariate data-analysis approaches to: (1) demonstrate that this framework may be used to obtain reproducible SPMs from any data-analysis approach on a common Z-score scale (rSPM[Z]); (2) demonstrate that the histogram of a rSPM[Z] image may be modeled as the sum of a data-analysis-dependent noise distribution and a task-dependent, Gaussian signal distribution that scales monotonically with our reproducibility performance metric; (3) explore the relation between prediction and reproducibility performance metrics with an emphasis on bias-variance tradeoffs for flexible, multivariate models; and (4) measure the broad range of reproducibility SNRs and the significant influence of individual subjects. A companion paper describes learning curves for four of these 12 data sets, which describe an alternative mutual-information prediction metric and NPAIRS reproducibility as a function of training-set sizes from 2 to 18 subjects. We propose the NPAIRS framework as a validation tool for testing and optimizing methodological choices and tools in functional neuroimaging.},

Prominent in these are actor-critic models of basal ganglia functioning, which build on the strong resemblance between dopamine neuron activity and the temporal difference prediction error signal in the critic, and between dopamine-dependent long-term synaptic plasticity in the striatum and learning guided by a prediction error signal in the actor. We selectively review several actor-critic models of the basal ganglia with an emphasis on two important aspects: the way in which models of the critic reproduce the temporal dynamics of dopamine firing, and the extent to which models of the actor take into account known basal ganglia anatomy and physiology. To complement the efforts to relate basal ganglia mechanisms to reinforcement learning (RL), we introduce an alternative approach to modeling a critic network, which uses Evolutionary Computation techniques to 'evolve' an optimal RL mechanism, and relate the evolved mechanism to the basic model of the critic. We conclude our discussion of models of the critic by a critical discussion of the anatomical plausibility of implementations of a critic in basal ganglia circuitry, and conclude that such implementations build on assumptions that are inconsistent with the known anatomy of the basal ganglia. We return to the actor component of the actor-critic model, which is usually modeled at the striatal level with very little detail. We describe an alternative model of the basal ganglia which takes into account several important, and previously neglected, anatomical and physiological characteristics of basal ganglia-thalamocortical connectivity and suggests that the basal ganglia performs reinforcement-biased dimensionality reduction of cortical inputs. We further suggest that since such selective encoding may bias the representation at the level of the frontal cortex towards the selection of rewarded plans and actions, the reinforcement-driven dimensionality reduction framework may serve as a basis for basal ganglia actor models. We conclude with a short discussion of the dual role of the dopamine signal in RL and in behavioral switching.},

abstract = {The capacity to accurately evaluate the causal effectiveness of our actions is key to successfully adapting to changing environments. Here we scanned subjects using functional magnetic resonance imaging while they pressed a button to earn money as the response-reward relationship changed over time. Subjects' judgments about the causal efficacy of their actions reflected the objective contingency between the rate of button pressing and the amount of money they earned. Neural responses in medial orbitofrontal cortex and dorsomedial striatum were modulated as a function of contingency, by increasing in activity during sessions when actions were highly causal compared with when they were not. Moreover, medial prefrontal cortex tracked local changes in action-outcome correlations, implicating this region in the on-line computation of contingency. These results reveal the involvement of distinct brain regions in the computational processes that establish the causal efficacy of actions, providing insight into the neural mechanisms underlying the adaptive control of behavior.},

For a new categories it is not generaliation, but for all other instances.  Is reversal, just new creation, if so collision.  Solved by association model?

A good definition of category is ...

An alternative, BG is involved with associations, which are then categorized elsewhere.   However there is learning boost for similar categories (which could be due to ctx modulation; emotion/attention can modulate str response).

cortex (ctx) --> str (striatum) {\&} subthalamic nucleus (stn) 
str {\&} stn --> bg output nuclei {\&} substantia nigra.
bg out --> thalamus --> ctx

connections from str to bg out are labeled line like, which create distinct   
"cortostriatal" loops.  

Four loops have been identified (by Lawrence (1998)).

1) executive (spatial)
2) motor -- select based on viscat results?
3) motivational (affective)
4) visual -- vis stim to catagories (action indep), is not dopmaine dependent?  Involves body and tail, does not require the inferotemp lobe (abaliation study)

There 3 aspects to cat (all discussed in context of bg)

1) representation
2) behav selection
3) learning 


It is unclear if and how the bg effect generalization.  generalization could occur by ctx convergence of bg/str.

abstract = {Application of multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data enables reconstruction and classification of cognitive status from brain activity. However, previous studies using MVPA have extracted information about cognitive status that is experienced simultaneously with fMRI scanning, but not one that will be observed after the scanning. In this study, by focusing on activity in the medial temporal lobe (MTL), we demonstrate that MVPA on fMRI data is capable of predicting subsequent recognition performance. In this experiment, six runs of fMRI signals were acquired during encoding of phonogram stimuli. In the analysis, using data acquired in runs 1-3, we first conducted MVPA-based voxel-wise search for the clusters in the MTL whose signals contained the most information about subsequent recognition performance. Next, using the fMRI signals acquired in runs 1-3 from the selected clusters, we trained a classifier function in MVPA. Finally, the trained classifier function was applied to fMRI signals acquired in runs 4-6. Consequently, we succeeded in predicting the subsequent recognition performance for stimuli studied in runs 4-6 with significant accuracy. This accurate prediction suggests that MVPA can extract information that is associated not only with concurrent cognitive status, but also with behavior in the near future.},

A strong test of this hypothesis is to require a computational model of the basal ganglia to generate integrated selection sequences in an autonomous agent, we therefore describe a robot architecture into which such a model is embedded, and require it to control action selection in a robotic task inspired by animal observations. Our results demonstrate effective action selection by the embedded model under a wide range of sensory and motivational conditions. When confronted with multiple, high salience alternatives, the robot also exhibits forms of behavioral disintegration that show similarities to animal behavior in conflict situations. The model is shown to cast light on recent neurobiological findings concerning behavioral switching and sequencing.},

abstract = {The giant synapse in the squid stellate ganglion has served as a model in the understanding of normal synaptic transmission, but has not been used extensively in the study of changes in external ion concentrations or pharmacological agents. This anomaly is due primarily to the substantial diffusion barrier that exists between the synapse and the bathing medium. The present study describes a technique for the rapid introduction of substances into the synapse by perfusion through the arterial blood supply that improves access by at least 50-fold. This is demonstrated by treat- ments known to block the Ca2+ activated release of transmitter from the nerve terminal: Ca2+-free medium, ~a ~+, and Cd2+. Whereas such treatments take 20 minutes to 3 hours to block transmitter release with bath application, with perfusion they act within a few seconds. The excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) is reduced below action potential threshold in 5 to 22 seconds, and disappears completely in less than a minute. In addition, the use of pressurized O2 to drive the perfusate through the preparation eliminates the need for superfusion with O2 and aids in the long term maintenance of the ganglion. This study confirms the important role of Ca2+ in the release of transmitter at the giant synapse, and opens up this neurobiologically im- portant preparation for ionic and pharmacologic evaluation.},

abstract = {Working memory function declines across the lifespan. Computational models of aging attribute such memory impairments to reduced distinctiveness between neural representations of different mental states in old age, a phenomenon termed dedifferentiation. These models predict that neural distinctiveness should be reduced uniformly across experimental conditions in older adults. In contrast, the Compensation-Related Utilization of Neural Circuits Hypothesis (CRUNCH) model predicts that the distinctiveness of neural representations should be increased in older adults (relative to young adults) at low levels of task demand but reduced at high levels of demand. The present study used multi-voxel pattern analysis to measure the effects of age and task demands on the distinctiveness of the neural representations of verbal and visuospatial working memory. Neural distinctiveness was estimated separately for memory encoding, maintenance, and retrieval, and for low, medium, and high memory loads. Results from sensory cortex during encoding and retrieval were consistent with the dedifferentiation hypothesis: distinctiveness of visual cortical representations during these phases was uniformly reduced in older adults, irrespective of memory load. However, maintenance-related responses in prefrontal and parietal regions yielded a strikingly different pattern of results. At low loads, older adults showed higher distinctiveness than younger adults; at high loads, this pattern reversed, such that distinctiveness was higher in young adults. This interaction between age group and memory load is at odds with the dedifferentiation hypothesis but consistent with CRUNCH. In sum, our results provide partial support for both dedifferentiation- and compensation-based models; we argue that comprehensive theories of cognitive aging must incorporate aspects of both models to fully explain complex patterns of age-related neuro-cognitive change.},

title = {Interactions Between LTP- and LTD-Inducing Stimulation in the Sensorimotor Cortex of the Awake Freely Moving Rat},
abstract = {Bidirectional modifications in synaptic efficacy are central components in models of cortical learning and memory. More recently, the regulation of synaptic plasticity according to the history of synaptic activation, termed \tt"metaplasticity,\tt" has become a focus of research on the physiology of memory. Here we explore such interactions between long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in the chronically prepared rat. The effects of successive high- and low-frequency stimulation were examined in sensorimotor cortex in the adult, freely moving rat. High-frequency (300 Hz) stimulation (HFS) applied to the white matter was used to induce LTP, and prolonged, low-frequency (1 Hz) stimulation (LFS) was used to induce either depotentiation or LTD. Combined stimulation (HFS/LFS or LFS/HFS) during the induction phase attenuated potentiation effects only if the LFS followed the HFS. LTD induced by LFS alone was expressed as a reduction in the amplitude of both short- and long-latency field potential components, whereas depotentiation was primarily expressed as a decrease in the amplitude of the potentiated long-latency component. In other experiments, LTP (or LTD) was induced to asymptotic levels before applying LFS (or HFS). LFS caused depotentiation of the late component but had no measurable effect on the early component. HFS reversed previously induced LTD, but the potentiation decayed more rapidly than usual. LTP and LTD therefore modulate each other in the awake, behaving rat.},

Previous evidence has suggested that the 'ups' and 'downs' of melodic contour are categorically and automatically processed, but knowledge of the brain regions that discriminate different types of contour is limited. Here, we examined melodic contour discrimination using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) of fMRI data. Twelve non-musicians were presented with various ascending and descending melodic sequences while being scanned. Whole-brain MVPA was used to identify regions in which the local pattern of activity accurately discriminated between contour categories. We identified three distinct cortical loci: the right superior temporal sulcus (rSTS), the left inferior parietal lobule (lIPL), and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). These results complement previous findings of melodic processing within the rSTS, and extend our understanding of the way in which abstract auditory sequences are categorized by the human brain.},

abstract = {Neurons in a small number of brain structures detect rewards and reward-predicting stimuli and are active during the expectation of predictable food and liquid rewards. These neurons code the reward information according to basic terms of various behavioural theories that seek to explain reward-directed learning, approach behaviour and decision-making. The involved brain structures include groups of dopamine neurons, the striatum including the nucleus accumbens, the orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala. The reward information is fed to brain structures involved in decision-making and organisation of behaviour, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and possibly the parietal cortex. The neural coding of basic reward terms derived from formal theories puts the neurophysiological investigation of reward mechanisms on firm conceptual grounds and provides neural correlates for the function of rewards in learning, approach behaviour and decision-making.},

abstract = {We reported previously that as monkeys used abstract response strategies to choose spatial goals, 1 population of prefrontal cortex neurons encoded future goals (F cells), whereas a largely separate population encoded previous goals (P cells). Here, to better understand the mechanisms of goal selection and maintenance, we studied correlated activity among pairs of these neurons. Among the 3 possible types of pairs, F-F and F-P pairs often exhibited significant correlations when and after monkeys selected future goals but P-P pairs rarely did. These correlations were stronger when monkeys shifted from a previous goal than when they stayed with that goal. In addition, members of F-F pairs usually preferred the same goal and thus shared both prospective coding and spatial tuning properties. In contrast, cells composing F-P pairs usually had different spatial preferences and thus shared neither coding nor spatial tuning properties. On the assumption that the neurons composing a pair send convergent outputs to target neurons, their correlated activity could enhance their efficacy in context-dependent goal selection, goal maintenance, and the transformation of goal choices into action.},

abstract = {Pattern recognition methods have shown that functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data can reveal significant information about brain activity. For example, in the debate of how object categories are represented in the brain, multivariate analysis has been used to provide evidence of a distributed encoding scheme [Science 293:5539 (2001) 2425-2430]. Many follow-up studies have employed different methods to analyze human fMRI data with varying degrees of success [Nature reviews 7:7 (2006) 523-534]. In this study, we compare four popular pattern recognition methods: correlation analysis, support-vector machines (SVM), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and Gaussian na{\"\i}ve Bayes (GNB), using data collected at high field (7 Tesla) with higher resolution than usual fMRI studies. We investigate prediction performance on single trials and for averages across varying numbers of stimulus presentations. The performance of the various algorithms depends on the nature of the brain activity being categorized: for several tasks, many of the methods work well, whereas for others, no method performs above chance level. An important factor in overall classification performance is careful preprocessing of the data, including dimensionality reduction, voxel selection and outlier elimination.},

abstract = {Activity changes in a large subset of midbrain dopamine neurons fulfill numerous assumptions of learning theory by encoding a prediction error between actual and predicted reward. This computational interpretation of dopaminergic spike activity invites the important question of how changes in spike rate are translated into changes in dopamine delivery at target neural structures. Using electrochemical detection of rapid dopamine release in the striatum of freely moving rats, we established that a single dynamic model can capture all the measured fluctuations in dopamine delivery. This model revealed three independent short-term adaptive processes acting to control dopamine release. These short-term components generalized well across animals and stimulation patterns and were preserved under anesthesia. The model has implications for the dynamic filtering interposed between changes in spike production and forebrain dopamine release.},

title = {Cortical substrates for exploratory decisions in humans},
abstract = {Decision making in an uncertain environment poses a conflict between the opposing demands of gathering and exploiting information. In a classic illustration of this 'exploration-exploitation' dilemma, a gambler choosing between multiple slot machines balances the desire to select what seems, on the basis of accumulated experience, the richest option, against the desire to choose a less familiar option that might turn out more advantageous (and thereby provide information for improving future decisions). Far from representing idle curiosity, such exploration is often critical for organisms to discover how best to harvest resources such as food and water. In appetitive choice, substantial experimental evidence, underpinned by computational reinforcement learning (RL) theory, indicates that a dopaminergic, striatal and medial prefrontal network mediates learning to exploit. In contrast, although exploration has been well studied from both theoretical and ethological perspectives, its neural substrates are much less clear. Here we show, in a gambling task, that human subjects' choices can be characterized by a computationally well-regarded strategy for addressing the explore/exploit dilemma. Furthermore, using this characterization to classify decisions as exploratory or exploitative, we employ functional magnetic resonance imaging to show that the frontopolar cortex and intraparietal sulcus are preferentially active during exploratory decisions. In contrast, regions of striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex exhibit activity characteristic of an involvement in value-based exploitative decision making. The results suggest a model of action selection under uncertainty that involves switching between exploratory and exploitative behavioural modes, and provide a computationally precise characterization of the contribution of key decision-related brain systems to each of these functions.},

title = {The confounding effect of response amplitude on MVPA performance measures},
abstract = {Multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) is proving very powerful in the analysis of fMRI timeseries data, yielding surprising sensitivity, in many different contexts, to the response characteristics of neurons in a given brain region. However, MVPA yields a metric (classification performance) that does not readily lend itself to quantitative comparisons across experimental conditions, brain regions or people. This is because performance is influenced by a number of factors other than the sensitivity of neurons to the experimental manipulation. One such factor that varies widely but has been largely ignored in MVPA studies is the amplitude of the response being decoded. In a noisy system, it is expected that measured classification performance will decline with declining response amplitude, even if the underlying neuronal specificity is constant. We document the relationship between response amplitude and classification performance in the context of orientation decoding in the visual cortex. Flickering sine gratings were presented at each of two orthogonal orientations in a block design (multivariate experiment) or an event-related design (univariate experiment). Response amplitude was manipulated by varying stimulus contrast. Orientation classification performance in retinotopically defined occipital area V1 increased approximately linearly with the logarithm of stimulus contrast. As expected, univariate response amplitude also increased with contrast. Similar results were obtained in V2, V3 and V3A. Plotting classification performance against response amplitude gave a function with a compressive non-linearity that was well fit by a power function. Knowledge of this function potentially allows adjustment of classification performance to take account of the effect of response size, making comparisons across brain areas, categories or people more meaningful.},

title = {Multiscale pattern analysis of orientation-selective activity in the primary visual cortex},
abstract = {Although orientation columns are less than a millimeter in width, recent neuroimaging studies indicate that viewed orientations can be decoded from cortical activity patterns sampled at relatively coarse resolutions of several millimeters. One proposal is that these differential signals arise from random spatial irregularities in the columnar map. However, direct support for this hypothesis has yet to be obtained. Here, we used high-field, high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and multivariate pattern analysis to determine the spatial scales at which orientation-selective information can be found in the primary visual cortex (V1) of cats and humans. We applied a multiscale pattern analysis approach in which fine- and coarse-scale signals were first removed by ideal spatial lowpass and highpass filters, and the residual activity patterns then analyzed by linear classifiers. Cat visual cortex, imaged at 0.3125 mm resolution, showed a strong orientation signal at the scale of individual columns. Nonetheless, reliable orientation bias could still be found at spatial scales of several millimeters. In the human visual cortex, imaged at 1 mm resolution, a majority of orientation information was found on scales of millimeters, with small contributions from global spatial biases exceeding approximately 1 cm. Our high-resolution imaging results demonstrate a reliable millimeters-scale orientation signal, likely emerging from irregular spatial arrangements of orientation columns and their supporting vasculature. fMRI pattern analysis methods are thus likely to be sensitive to signals originating from other irregular columnar structures elsewhere in the brain.},

On the other hand, drugs with aversive properties (e.g., agonists of kappa opioid receptors, U-50,488, tifluadom, and bremazocine) reduced dopamine release in the accumbens and in the caudate and elicited hypomotility. Haloperidol, a neuroleptic drug, increased extracellular dopamine concentrations, but this effect was not preferential for the accumbens and was associated with hypomotility and sedation. Drugs not abused by humans [e.g., imipramine (an antidepressant), atropine (an antimuscarinic drug), and diphenhydramine (an antihistamine)] failed to modify synaptic dopamine concentrations. These results provide biochemical evidence for the hypothesis that stimulation of dopamine transmission in the limbic system might be a fundamental property of drugs that are abused.},

title = {Sensing and expressing homeostatic synaptic plasticity},
abstract = {Chronic changes in the level of neuronal activity (over a period of days) trigger compensatory changes in synaptic function that seem to contribute to the homeostatic restoration of neuronal activity. Changes in both quantal amplitude and vesicle release contribute to homeostatic synaptic plasticity, but they are often considered as the same phenomenon. In this review, we propose a new approach to studying how neuronal activity is sensed and changes in synaptic function are expressed during synaptic compensation. Changes in quantal amplitude and vesicle release should be considered separately in an attempt to identify the sensors that trigger homeostatic synaptic plasticity. Although data are limited, current evidence suggests that the sensors triggering changes in the quantal amplitude and vesicle release exist at different locations. Furthermore, it is important to recognize that at least two different mechanisms underlie changes in quantal amplitude during homeostatic synaptic plasticity: changes in both the number of postsynaptic receptors and loading of synaptic vesicles with neurotransmitter. Finally, modulation of the probability of neurotransmitter release contributes to the changes in vesicle release associated with homeostatic synaptic plasticity. An improved understanding of where and how neuronal activity is sensed, in addition to the types of changes in synaptic function that are induced, will be needed both to design future experiments and to understand the consequences of synaptic compensation following injury to the nervous system.},

title = {Neuronal activity in the rodent dorsal striatum in sequential navigation: separation of spatial and reward responses on the multiple T task},
abstract = {The striatum plays an important role in "habitual" learning and memory and has been hypothesized to implement a reinforcement-learning algorithm to select actions to perform given the current sensory input. Many experimental approaches to striatal activity have made use of temporally structured tasks, which imply that the striatal representation is temporal. To test this assumption, we recorded neurons in the dorsal striatum of rats running a sequential navigation task: the multiple T maze. Rats navigated a sequence of four T maze turns to receive food rewards delivered in two locations. The responses of neurons that fired phasically were examined. Task-responsive phasic neurons were active as rats ran on the maze (maze-responsive) or during reward receipt (reward-responsive). Neither maze- nor reward-responsive neurons encoded simple motor commands: maze-responses were not well correlated with the shape of the rat's path and most reward-responsive neurons did not fire at similar rates at both food-delivery sites. Maze-responsive neurons were active at one or more locations on the maze, but these responses did not cluster at spatial landmarks such as turns. Across sessions the activity of maze-responsive neurons was highly correlated when rats ran the same maze. Maze-responses encoded the location of the rat on the maze and imply a spatial representation in the striatum in a task with prominent spatial demands. Maze-responsive and reward-responsive neurons were two separate populations, suggesting a divergence in striatal information processing of navigation and reward.},

However, the neural mechanisms that compute EV have not been characterized. Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined neural activation as subjects anticipated monetary gains and losses that varied in magnitude and probability. Group analyses indicated that, although the subcortical nucleus accumbens (NAcc) activated proportional to anticipated gain magnitude, the cortical mesial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) additionally activated according to anticipated gain probability. Individual difference analyses indicated that, although NAcc activation correlated with self-reported positive arousal, MPFC activation correlated with probability estimates. These findings suggest that mesolimbic brain regions support the computation of EV in an ascending and distributed manner: whereas subcortical regions represent an affective component, cortical regions also represent a probabilistic component, and, furthermore, may integrate the two.},

Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with concurrent indirect, eye-movement-based memory measures, we obtained evidence that hippocampal activity predicted expressions of relational memory in subsequent patterns of viewing, even when explicit, conscious retrieval failed. Additionally, activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex and functional connectivity between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were greater for correct than for incorrect trials. Together, these results suggest that hippocampal activity can support the expression of relational memory even when explicit retrieval fails and that recruitment of a broader cortical network may be required to support explicit associative recognition.},

abstract = {Neuropsychological findings together with recent advances in neuroanatomical and neuroimaging techniques have spurred the investigation of cerebellar contributions to cognition. One cognitive process that has been the focus of much research is working memory, in particular its verbal component. Influenced by Baddeley's cognitive theory of working memory, cerebellar activation during verbal working memory tasks has been predominantly attributed to the cerebellum's involvement in an articulatory rehearsal network. Recent neuroimaging and neuropsychological findings are inconsistent with a simple motor view of the cerebellum's function in verbal working memory. The present article examines these findings and their implications for an articulatory rehearsal proposal of cerebellar function. Moving beyond cognitive theory, we propose two alternative explanations for cerebellar involvement in verbal working memory: Error-driven adjustment and internal timing. These general theories of cerebellar function have been successfully adapted from the motor literature to explain cognitive functions of the cerebellum. We argue that these theories may also provide a useful framework to understand the non-motor contributions of the cerebellum to verbal working memory.},

abstract = {Two experiments were conducted in which the effects of different feedback displays on decision criterion learning were examined in a perceptual categorization task with unequal cost-benefits. In Experiment 1, immediate versus delayed feedback was combined factorially with objective versus optimal classifier feedback. Immediate versus delayed feedback had no effect. Performance improved significantly over blocks with optimal classifier feedback and remained relatively stable with objective feedback. Experiment 2 used a within-subjects design that allowed a test of model-based instantiations of the flat-maxima (von Winterfeldt {\&} Edwards, 1982) and competition between reward and accuracy (Maddox {\&} Bohil, 1998a) hypotheses in isolation and of a hybrid model that incorporated assumptions from both hypotheses. The model-based analyses indicated that the flat-maxima model provided a good description of early learning but that the assumptions of the hybrid model were necessary to account for later learning. An examination of the hybrid model parameters indicated that the emphasis placed on accuracy maximization generally declined with experience for optimal classifier feedback but remained high, and fairly constant for objective classifier feedback. Implications for cost-benefit training are discussed.},

abstract = {How does attention interact with learning? Kruschke [Kruschke, J.K. (2001). Toward a unified Model of Attention in Associative Learning. J. Math. Psychol. 45, 812-863.] proposed a model (EXIT) that captures Mackintosh's [Mackintosh, N.J. (1975). A theory of attention: Variations in the associability of stimuli with reinforcement. Psychological Review, 82(4), 276-298.] framework for attentional modulation of associative learning. We developed a computational model that showed analogous interactions between selective attention and associative learning, but is significantly simplified and, in contrast to EXIT, is motivated by neurophysiological findings. Competition among input representations in the internal representation layer, which increases the contrast between stimuli, is critical for simulating these interactions in human behavior. Furthermore, this competition is modulated in a way that might be consistent with the phasic activation of the central cholinergic system, which modulates activity in sensory cortices. Specifically, phasic increases in acetylcholine can cause increased excitability of both pyramidal excitatory neurons in cortical layers II/III and cortical GABAergic inhibitory interneurons targeting the same pyramidal neurons. These effects result in increased attentional contrast in our model. This model thus represents an initial attempt to link human attentional learning data with underlying neural substrates.},

title = {Motivation-dependent responses in the human caudate nucleus},
abstract = {Motivation is a complex process that leads to completion or avoidance of a behavior. Past research strongly implicates the basal ganglia in a circuit integral for the control of motivation. Specifically, the human striatum has been shown to process reward information, differentiating between monetary rewards and punishments in recent neuroimaging experiments. It is unclear, however, how the dorsal striatum, particularly the caudate nucleus, responds to changes in the motivational context of a task. Using an event-related design, where participants were given positive and negative feedback upon guessing the value of an unknown card, we manipulated the motivational context of the task by dividing trials into periods of high incentive (where visual feedback indicated monetary rewards and punishments) and low incentive (where visual feedback indicated only accuracy). We found that activity in the caudate nucleus was strongly influenced by the different incentive periods. The hemodynamic response was characterized by a larger rise at the onset of trials and larger differences between positive and negative feedback during periods of high incentive. These results suggest that changes in motivation are capable of modulating basal ganglia activity, and further support an important role for the caudate nucleus in affective processing.},

Nosofsky (1996) compared a linear decision-bound model with the generalized context model (GCM) in their ability to account for categorization data from experiments that used integral- or separable-dimension stimuli and required selective attention or attention to both dimensions. McKinley and Nosofsky (1996) found support for the GCM and concluded that decision-bound theory needs to incorporate assumptions about selective attention. In this commentary it is argued that (a) unlike the GCM, decision-bound theory provides a framework for independently investigating perceptual and decisional forms of selective attention; (b) the effect of stimulus integrality on the form of the optimal decision bound is misinterpreted; (c) averaged data is biased against decision-bound theory and toward the GCM; (d) many a priori predictions of the GCM are violated empirically; and (e) exemplar theory has lost much of its initial theoretical structure.},

abstract = {Episodic memory retrieval is thought to involve reinstatement of the neurocognitive processes engaged when an episode was encoded. Prior fMRI studies and computational models have suggested that reinstatement is limited to instances in which specific episodic details are recollected. We used multivoxel pattern-classification analyses of fMRI data to investigate how reinstatement is associated with different memory judgments, particularly those accompanied by recollection versus a feeling of familiarity (when recollection is absent). Classifiers were trained to distinguish between brain activity patterns associated with different encoding tasks and were subsequently applied to recognition-related fMRI data to determine the degree to which patterns were reinstated. Reinstatement was evident during both recollection- and familiarity-based judgments, providing clear evidence that reinstatement is not sufficient for eliciting a recollective experience. The findings are interpreted as support for a continuous, recollection-related neural signal that has been central to recent debate over the nature of recognition memory processes.},

title = {A physiologically plausible model of action selection and oscillatory activity in the basal ganglia},
abstract = {The basal ganglia (BG) have long been implicated in both motor function and dysfunction. It has been proposed that the BG form a centralized action selection circuit, resolving conflict between multiple neural systems competing for access to the final common motor pathway. We present a new spiking neuron model of the BG circuitry to test this proposal, incorporating all major features and many physiologically plausible details. We include the following: effects of dopamine in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus (GP), transmission delays between neurons, and specific distributions of synaptic inputs over dendrites. All main parameters were derived from experimental studies. We find that the BG circuitry supports motor program selection and switching, which deteriorates under dopamine-depleted and dopamine-excessive conditions in a manner consistent with some pathologies associated with those dopamine states. We also validated the model against data describing oscillatory properties of BG. We find that the same model displayed detailed features of both gamma-band (30-80 Hz) and slow (approximately 1 Hz) oscillatory phenomena reported by Brown et al. (2002) and Magill et al. (2001), respectively. Only the parameters required to mimic experimental conditions (e.g., anesthetic) or manipulations (e.g., lesions) were changed. From the results, we derive the following novel predictions about the STN-GP feedback loop: (1) the loop is functionally decoupled by tonic dopamine under normal conditions and recoupled by dopamine depletion; (2) the loop does not show pacemaking activity under normal conditions in vivo (but does after combined dopamine depletion and cortical lesion); (3) the loop has a resonant frequency in the gamma-band.},

abstract = {Goal-directed behavior is believed to involve interactions of prefrontal cortical and limbic inputs in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), and their modulation by mesolimbic dopamine (DA) seems to be of primary importance in NAcc function. Using in vivo electrophysiological recordings simultaneously with DA system manipulation in rats, we show that tonic and phasic DA release selectively modulates hippocampal and prefrontal cortical inputs through D1 and D2 receptors, respectively. In addition, we also found that D1 activation and D2 inactivation in the NAcc produced behaviorally selective effects (learning versus set shifting of response strategy) that correspond to specific afferents. These results suggest that the dynamics of DA release regulate the balance between limbic and cortical drive through activation and inactivation of DA receptor subtypes in the accumbens, and this regulates goal-directed behavior.},

abstract = {This study compared the contribution of the general activating and specific cueing properties of Pavlovian stimuli to Pavlovian-instrumental transfer (PIT) and the role of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in mediating these effects. In Experiment 1, hungry rats initially received Pavlovian training, in which three distinct auditory stimuli predicted the delivery of three different food outcomes. Next, the rats were trained to perform two instrumental actions, each earning a unique outcome selected from the three used in Pavlovian conditioning. Finally, the effects of the three stimuli on performance of the two actions were assessed in extinction. Presentation of a stimulus that had been paired with the same outcome as an action increased its performance relative to the other action, demonstrating that PIT effects can be outcome selective. In contrast, presentation of the stimulus that predicted the outcome that was not earned during instrumental training facilitated the performance of both actions indiscriminately. This effect, but not the outcome-selective effect, was abolished by a shift from a hungry to a relatively sated state. Experiment 2 examined the effects of inactivation of the VTA on these two forms of PIT. VTA inactivation was found to attenuate PIT but, unlike satiety, did not appear to differentially affect the general or the outcome-selective forms of PIT. The VTA appears therefore to play an important but general role in the initiation of instrumental actions, enabling cues to influence performance whether they enhance responding by changes in arousal or by retrieving particular actions based on their consequences.},

title = {Feedback signals in the caudate reflect goal achievement on a declarative memory task},
abstract = {The striatum has been shown to be a key region in the processing of reward-related information. The head of the caudate nucleus has been implicated in processing performance feedback, or in other words, information about the outcomes of one's actions. However, feedback provides multiple types of information, and it is not clear which of these types of information drive a caudate response. We sought to determine whether the signal in the caudate differed when feedback was informative but only arbitrarily related to performance versus when it provided information about goal achievement. To do this, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine caudate activation during a feedback-based paired associate word-learning task. During an initial round of 60 distinct trials, participants chose one of two responses on each trial and received feedback about whether their responses were correct. On the subsequent two rounds, the 60 trials were repeated and participants chose their responses based on their memory of the correct answer. The caudate nuclei were strongly engaged only during the second two rounds, when feedback reflected the accuracy of memory. These results support the idea that feedback-based caudate activation is context dependent: the caudate can be engaged in feedback-based declarative memory tasks, but it is more strongly engaged when feedback is "earned" by performance than when it is informative but not tied to goal achievement.},

title = {Prediction error for free monetary reward in the human prefrontal cortex},
abstract = {Making predictions about future rewards is an important ability for primates, and its neurophysiological mechanisms have been studied extensively. One important approach is to identify neural systems that process errors related to reward prediction (i.e., areas that register the occurrence of unpredicted rewards and the failure of expected rewards). In monkeys that have learned to predict appetitive rewards during reward-directed behaviors, dopamine neurons reliably signal both types of prediction error. The mechanisms in the human brain involved in processing prediction error for monetary rewards are not well understood. Furthermore, nothing is known of how such systems operate when rewards are not contingent on behavior. We used event-related fMRI to localize responses to both classes of prediction error. Subjects were able to predict a monetary reward or a nonreward on the basis of a prior visual cue. On occasional trials, cue-outcome contingencies were reversed (unpredicted rewards and failure of expected rewards). Subjects were not required to make decisions or actions. We compared each type of prediction error trial with its corresponding control trial in which the same prediction did not fail. Each type of prediction error evoked activity in a distinct frontotemporal circuit. Unexpected reward failure evoked activity in the temporal cortex and frontal pole (area 10). Unpredicted rewards evoked activity in the orbitofrontal cortex, the frontal pole, parahippocampal cortex, and cerebellum. Activity time-locked to prediction errors in frontotemporal circuits suggests that they are involved in encoding the associations between visual cues and monetary rewards in the human brain.},

title = {Movement preparation and motor intention},
abstract = {This paper addresses the functional anatomy of movement representation. We have used associative visuomotor tasks with instructed delays to elicit motor preparatory activity. We regard such activity, when independent from transient stimulus-locked responses, as a likely candidate for the neural basis of movement representation (M. Jeannerod, The Cognitive Neuroscience of Action. Blackwell, Oxford, 1997). In a first event-related fMRI experiment, we found that preparing to move according to arbitrary visuomotor associations relies not only on parietofrontal circuitry, but also on portions of the posterior superior temporal sulcus. In a separate behavioral experiment, we discarded the hypothesis that such activities were confounded by working memory processes. In a second imaging experiment, we have further defined the relative contributions of these parietal, premotor, and temporal areas to the preparatory process and their involvement in motor representations. We conclude that posterior parietal cortex is interested in evaluating the potential motor significance of sensory stimuli, irrespectively of the likelihood of providing a response ("motor intention"). Conversely, preparatory activity in frontal premotor regions appears to be a function of the probability of a subsequent movement. Finally, on the basis of the present and published data, we suggest that posterior temporal cortex might be involved in the extraction of contextual and intentional cues during goal-oriented behavior.},

We propose that marketing actions, such as changes in the price of a product, can affect neural representations of experienced pleasantness. We tested this hypothesis by scanning human subjects using functional MRI while they tasted wines that, contrary to reality, they believed to be different and sold at different prices. Our results show that increasing the price of a wine increases subjective reports of flavor pleasantness as well as blood-oxygen-level-dependent activity in medial orbitofrontal cortex, an area that is widely thought to encode for experienced pleasantness during experiential tasks. The paper provides evidence for the ability of marketing actions to modulate neural correlates of experienced pleasantness and for the mechanisms through which the effect operates.},

title = {Conditional visuo-motor learning in primates: a key role for the basal ganglia},
abstract = {Sensory guidance of behavior often involves standard visuo-motor mapping of body movements onto objects and spatial locations. For example, looking at and reaching to grasp a glass of wine requires the mapping of the eyes and hand to the location of the glass in space, as well as the formation of a hand configuration appropriate to the shape of the glass. But our brain is far more than just a standard sensorimotor mapping machine. Through evolution, the brain of advanced mammals, in particular human and non-human primates, has acquired a formidable capacity to construct non-standard, arbitrary mapping using associations between external events and behavioral responses that bear no direct relationship. For example, we have all learned to stop at a red traffic light and to go at a green one, or to wait for a specific tone before dialing a phone number and to hang up when hearing a busy signal. These arbitrary associations are acquired through experience, thereby providing primates with a rich and flexible sensorimotor repertoire. Understanding how they are learned, and how they are recalled and used when the context requires them, has been one of the challenging issues for cognitive neuroscience. Valuable insights have been gained over the last two decades through the convergence of multiple complementary approaches. Human neuropsychology and experimental lesions in monkeys have identified a network of brain structures important for conditional sensorimotor associations, whereas imaging studies in healthy human subjects and electrophysiological recordings in awake monkeys have sought to identify the different functional processes underlying the overall function. The present review focuses on the contribution of a network linking the prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and dorsal premotor cortex, with special emphasis on results from recording experiments in monkeys. We will first review data pointing to a specific contribution of each component of the network to the performance of well-learned arbitrary visuo-motor associations, as well as data suggesting how novel associations are formed. Then we will propose a model positing that each component of the fronto-striatal network makes a specific contribution to the formation and/or execution of sensorimotor associations. In this model, the basal ganglia are thought to play a key role in linking the sensory, motor, and reward information necessary for arbitrary mapping.},

abstract = {Neurotrophins provide trophic and tropic support for different neuronal subpopulations in the developing and adult nervous systems. Expression of the neurotrophins and their receptors can be altered in several different disease or injury states that impact upon the functions in the central and peripheral nervous systems. The intracellular signals used by the neurotrophins are triggered by ligand binding to the cell surface Trk and p75NTR receptors. In general, signals emanating from Trk receptors support survival, growth and synaptic strengthening, while those emanating from p75NTR induce apoptosis, attenuate growth and weaken synaptic signaling. Mature neurotrophins are the preferred ligand for Trk proteins while p75NTR binds preferentially to the proneurotrophins and serves as a signaling component of the receptor complex for growth inhibitory molecules of central nervous system myelin {\$}[{\$}ie, myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein (OMgP) and Nogo{\$}]{\$}. The functional antagonism between Trk and p75NTR signaling may significantly impact the pathogenesis of human neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases and further complicate therapeutic uses of exogenous neurotrophins.

abstract = {This article examines how independent corticostriatal loops linking basal ganglia with cerebral cortex contribute to visual categorization. The first aspect of categorization discussed is the role of the visual corticostriatal loop, which connects the visual cortex and the body/tail of the caudate, in mapping visual stimuli to categories, including evaluating the degree to which this loop may generalize across individual category members. The second aspect of categorization discussed is the selection of appropriate actions or behaviors on the basis of category membership, and the role of the visual corticostriatal loop output and the motor corticostriatal loop, which connects motor planning areas with the putamen, in action selection. The third aspect of categorization discussed is how categories are learned with the aid of feedback linked dopaminergic projections to the basal ganglia. These projections underlie corticostriatal synaptic plasticity across the basal ganglia, and also serve as input to the executive and motivational corticostriatal loops that play a role in strategic use of feedback.},

abstract = {Modifications in the strengths of synapses are thought to underlie memory, learning, and development of cortical circuits. Many cellular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity have been investigated in which differential elevations of postsynaptic calcium concentrations play a key role in determining the direction and magnitude of synaptic changes. We have previously described a model of plasticity that uses calcium currents mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors as the associative signal for Hebbian learning. However, this model is not completely stable. Here, we propose a mechanism of stabilization through homeostatic regulation of intracellular calcium levels. With this model, synapses are stable and exhibit properties such as those observed in metaplasticity and synaptic scaling. In addition, the model displays synaptic competition, allowing structures to emerge in the synaptic space that reflect the statistical properties of the inputs. Therefore, the combination of a fast calcium-dependent learning and a slow stabilization mechanism can account for both the formation of selective receptive fields and the maintenance of neural circuits in a state of equilibrium.},

abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is widely used to study the operational organization of the human brain, but the exact relationship between the measured fMRI signal and the underlying neural activity is unclear. Here we present simultaneous intracortical recordings of neural signals and fMRI responses. We compared local field potentials (LFPs), single- and multi-unit spiking activity with highly spatio-temporally resolved blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI responses from the visual cortex of monkeys. The largest magnitude changes were observed in LFPs, which at recording sites characterized by transient responses were the only signal that significantly correlated with the haemodynamic response. Linear systems analysis on a trial-by-trial basis showed that the impulse response of the neurovascular system is both animal- and site-specific, and that LFPs yield a better estimate of BOLD responses than the multi-unit responses. These findings suggest that the BOLD contrast mechanism reflects the input and intracortical processing of a given area rather than its spiking output.},

abstract = {Visual stimuli that are frequently seen together become associated in long-term memory, such that the sight of one stimulus readily brings to mind the thought or image of the other. It has been hypothesized that acquisition of such long-term associative memories proceeds via the strengthening of connections between neurons representing the associated stimuli, such that a neuron initially responding only to one stimulus of an associated pair eventually comes to respond to both. Consistent with this hypothesis, studies have demonstrated that individual neurons in the primate inferior temporal cortex tend to exhibit similar responses to pairs of visual stimuli that have become behaviorally associated. In the present study, we investigated the role of these areas in the formation of conditional visual associations by monitoring the responses of individual neurons during the learning of new stimulus pairs. We found that many neurons in both area TE and perirhinal cortex came to elicit more similar neuronal responses to paired stimuli as learning proceeded. Moreover, these neuronal response changes were learning-dependent and proceeded with an average time course that paralleled learning. This experience-dependent plasticity of sensory representations in the cerebral cortex may underlie the learning of associations between objects.},

abstract = {The error-related negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe) are electrophysiological markers of error processing thought to originate in the medial frontal cortex. Previous studies using probabilistic reinforcement showed that individuals who learn more from negative than from positive feedback (negative learners) had larger ERNs than did positive learners. These findings support the dopamine (DA) reinforcement-learning hypothesis of the ERN and associated computational models. However, it remains unclear (1) to what extent these effects generalize to tasks outside the restricted probabilistic reinforcement-learning domain and (2) whether there is a dopaminergic source of these effects. To address these issues, we tested subjects' reinforcement-learning biases behaviorally and recorded EEG during an unrelated recognition memory experiment. Initial recognition responses were speeded, but the subjects were subsequently allowed to self-correct their responses. We found that negative learners, as assessed via probabilistic learning, had larger ERNs in the recognition memory task, suggestive of a common underlying enhanced error-processing mechanism. Negative learners also had enhanced Pes when self-correcting errors than did positive learners. Moreover, the ERN and Pe components contributed independently to negative learning. We also tested for a dopaminergic genetic basis of these ERP components. We analyzed the COMT val/met polymorphism, which has been linked to frontal DA levels. The COMT genotype affected Pe (but not ERN) magnitude; met/met homozygotes showed enhanced Pes to self-corrected errors, as compared with val carriers. These results are consistent with a role for the Pe and frontal monoamines in error awareness.},

abstract = {Summary Ca2+ influx through NMDA receptors (NMDA-Rs) triggers synaptic plasticity, gene transcription, and cytotoxicity, but little is known about the regulation of NMDA-Rs themselves. We used two-photon glutamate uncaging to activate NMDA-Rs on individual dendritic spines in rat CA1 neurons while we measured NMDA-R currents at the soma and {\$}[{\$}Ca2+{\$}]{\$} changes in spines. Low-frequency uncaging trains induced Ca2+-dependent long-term depression of NMDA-R-mediated synaptic currents. Additionally, uncaging trains caused a reduction in the Ca2+ accumulation per unit of NMDA-R current in spines due to a reduction in the fraction of the NMDA-R current carried by Ca2+. Induction of depression of NMDA-R-mediated Ca2+ influx required activation of NR2B-containing receptors. Receptors in single spines depressed rapidly in an all-or-none manner. These adaptive changes in NMDA-R function likely play a critical role in metaplasticity and in stabilizing activity levels in neuronal networks with Hebbian synapses.},

This approach is predicated on a linear convolution model and standard inferential statistics as employed by statistical parametric mapping. In particular we model evoked responses, and their differences, in terms of basis functions of the peri-stimulus time. This facilitates a characterization of the temporal response profiles that has a high effective temporal resolution relative to the repetition time. To demonstrate the technique we examined differential responses to visually presented words that had been seen prior to scanning or that were novel. The form of these differences involved both the magnitude and the latency of the response components. In this paper we focus on bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal responses that show deactivations for previously seen words and activations for novel words.},

In the present study, a new method was developed based on the regional homogeneity (ReHo), in which KCC was used to measure the similarity of the time series of a given voxel to those of its nearest neighbors in a voxel-wise way. Six healthy subjects performed left and right finger movement tasks in event-related design; five of them were additionally scanned in a rest condition. KCC was compared among the three conditions (left finger movement, right finger movement, and the rest). Results show that bilateral primary motor cortex (M1) had higher KCC in either left or right finger movement condition than in rest condition. Contrary to prediction and to activation pattern, KCC of ipsilateral M1 is significantly higher than contralateral M1 in unilateral finger movement conditions. These results support the previous electrophysiologic findings of increasing ipsilateral M1 excitation during unilateral movement. ReHo can consider as a complementary method to model-driven method, and it could help reveal the complexity of the human brain function. More work is needed to understand the neural mechanism underlying ReHo.},

title = {Learning and memory functions of the Basal Ganglia},
abstract = {Although the mammalian basal ganglia have long been implicated in motor behavior, it is generally recognized that the behavioral functions of this subcortical group of structures are not exclusively motoric in nature. Extensive evidence now indicates a role for the basal ganglia, in particular the dorsal striatum, in learning and memory. One prominent hypothesis is that this brain region mediates a form of learning in which stimulus-response (S-R) associations or habits are incrementally acquired. Support for this hypothesis is provided by numerous neurobehavioral studies in different mammalian species, including rats, monkeys, and humans. In rats and monkeys, localized brain lesion and pharmacological approaches have been used to examine the role of the basal ganglia in S-R learning. In humans, study of patients with neurodegenerative diseases that compromise the basal ganglia, as well as research using brain neuroimaging techniques, also provide evidence of a role for the basal ganglia in habit learning. Several of these studies have dissociated the role of the basal ganglia in S-R learning from those of a cognitive or declarative medial temporal lobe memory system that includes the hippocampus as a primary component. Evidence suggests that during learning, basal ganglia and medial temporal lobe memory systems are activated simultaneously and that in some learning situations competitive interference exists between these two systems.},

title = {The derivation of direction selectivity in the striate cortex},
abstract = {In the central visual pathway of binocular animals, the property of directional selectivity (DS) is first exhibited in striate cortex. In this study, we sought to determine the neural circuitry underlying the transformation from non-DS neurons to DS cortical cells. In a well established model, DS receptive fields (RFs) are derived from the sum of two non-DS inputs with 90 degrees (quadrature) spatiotemporal phase differences. We explored possible input sources for this model, which include non-DS simple cells and lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) neurons, by examination of spatiotemporal RFs of single cells and of pairs of cells. We find that distributions of non-DS simple RFs do not match the temporal predictions of the quadrature model because of a lack of long-latency responses. The long-latency inputs could potentially arise from lagged LGN afferents. However, analysis of cell pairs indicates that DS cells receive cortical input from non-DS simple cells for both short- and long-latency components, with temporal phase differences typically <90 degrees. Furthermore, the distribution of minimum phase differences needed to generate DS cells overlaps that exhibited by non-DS simple cells. Considered together, these results are consistent with a linear model whereby DS simple cells are formed from simple-cell inputs, with temporal phase differences often less than quadrature.},

abstract = {The performance of an experimental design for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be characterized by its estimation efficiency, which is the ability to make an estimate of the hemodynamic response, its detection power, which is the ability to detect an activation, and its conditional entropy, which is a measure of the randomness of the design. In Liu and Frank [Neuroimage 21 (2004) 387-400], it is shown that there is a fundamental theoretical trade-off between estimation efficiency and detection power for experiments with multiple trial types and that there is an empirical relation between estimation efficiency and conditional entropy. This paper provides an intuitive interpretation of the theoretical results and examines the practical implications of these results for the optimal design of fMRI experiments with multiple trial types. The properties of block designs, permuted block designs, m-sequence designs, clustered m-sequence designs, and mixed designs are explored. It is shown that these designs nearly achieve the theoretically predicted performance and can be used in practice to obtain advantageous trade-offs among efficiency, power, and entropy.},

title = {Reinforcement learning signals in the human striatum distinguish learners from nonlearners during reward-based decision making},
abstract = {The computational framework of reinforcement learning has been used to forward our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying reward learning and decision-making behavior. It is known that humans vary widely in their performance in decision-making tasks. Here, we used a simple four-armed bandit task in which subjects are almost evenly split into two groups on the basis of their performance: those who do learn to favor choice of the optimal action and those who do not. Using models of reinforcement learning we sought to determine the neural basis of these intrinsic differences in performance by scanning both groups with functional magnetic resonance imaging. We scanned 29 subjects while they performed the reward-based decision-making task. Our results suggest that these two groups differ markedly in the degree to which reinforcement learning signals in the striatum are engaged during task performance. While the learners showed robust prediction error signals in both the ventral and dorsal striatum during learning, the nonlearner group showed a marked absence of such signals. Moreover, the magnitude of prediction error signals in a region of dorsal striatum correlated significantly with a measure of behavioral performance across all subjects. These findings support a crucial role of prediction error signals, likely originating from dopaminergic midbrain neurons, in enabling learning of action selection preferences on the basis of obtained rewards. Thus, spontaneously observed individual differences in decision making performance demonstrate the suggested dependence of this type of learning on the functional integrity of the dopaminergic striatal system in humans.},

title = {Temporal difference modeling of the blood-oxygen level dependent response during aversive conditioning in humans: effects of dopaminergic modulation},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prediction error (PE) hypothesized by the temporal difference model has been shown to correlate with the phasic activity of dopamine neurons during reward learning and the blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response during reward and aversive conditioning tasks. We hypothesized that dopamine would modulate the PE related signal in aversive conditioning and that haloperidol would reduce PE related activity, while an acute dose of amphetamine would increase PE related activity in the ventral striatum. METHODS: Healthy participants took an acute dose of amphetamine, haloperidol, or placebo. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the BOLD signal while they carried out an aversive conditioning task, using cutaneous electrical stimulation as the unconditioned stimulus (US) and yellow and blue circles as conditioned stimulus (CS+ and CS-, respectively). RESULTS: Prediction error related BOLD activity was seen only in the ventral striatum in the placebo subjects. The subjects given amphetamine showed a wider network of PE related BOLD activity, including the ventral striatum, globus pallidus, putamen, insula, anterior cingulate, and substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area. Haloperidol subjects did not show PE related activity in any of these regions. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide the first demonstration that the modulation of dopamine transmission affects both the physiological correlates and PE related BOLD activity during aversive learning.},

title = {Action and outcome encoding in the primate caudate nucleus},
abstract = {The basal ganglia appear to have a central role in reinforcement learning. Previous experiments, focusing on activity preceding movement execution, support the idea that dorsal striatal neurons bias action selection according to the expected values of actions. However, many phasically active striatal neurons respond at a time too late to initiate or select movements. Given the data suggesting a role for the basal ganglia in reinforcement learning, postmovement activity may therefore reflect evaluative processing important for learning the values of actions. To better understand these postmovement neurons, we determined whether individual striatal neurons encode information about saccade direction, whether a reward had been received, or both. We recorded from phasically active neurons in the caudate nucleus while monkeys performed a probabilistically rewarded delayed saccade task. Many neurons exhibited peak responses after saccade execution (77 of 149) that were often tuned for the direction of the preceding saccade (61 of 77). Of those neurons responding during the reward epoch, one subset showed direction tuning for the immediately preceding saccade (43 of 60), whereas another subset responded differentially on rewarded versus unrewarded trials (35 of 60). We found that there was relatively little overlap of these properties in individual neurons. The encoding of action and outcome was performed by largely separate populations of caudate neurons that were active after movement execution. Thus, striatal neurons active primarily after a movement appear to be segregated into two distinct groups that provide complimentary information about the outcomes of actions.},

(1961) 643] and others raised to neoclassicism either by bounding the reach of economic theory or by turning to descriptive approaches. While both of these strategies have been enormously fruitful, neither has provided a clear programmatic approach that aspires to a complete understanding of human decision making as did neoclassicism. There is, however, growing evidence that economists and neurobiologists are now beginning to reveal the physical mechanisms by which the human neuroarchitecture accomplishes decision making. Although in their infancy, these studies suggest both a single unified framework for understanding human decision making and a methodology for constraining the scope and structure of economic theory. Indeed, there is already evidence that these studies place mathematical constraints on existing economic models. This article reviews some of those constraints and suggests the outline of a neuroeconomic theory of decision.},

title = {Short-term memory traces for action bias in human reinforcement learning},
abstract = {Recent experimental and theoretical work on reinforcement learning has shed light on the neural bases of learning from rewards and punishments. One fundamental problem in reinforcement learning is the credit assignment problem, or how to properly assign credit to actions that lead to reward or punishment following a delay. Temporal difference learning solves this problem, but its efficiency can be significantly improved by the addition of eligibility traces (ET). In essence, ETs function as decaying memories of previous choices that are used to scale synaptic weight changes. It has been shown in theoretical studies that ETs spanning a number of actions may improve the performance of reinforcement learning. However, it remains an open question whether including ETs that persist over sequences of actions allows reinforcement learning models to better fit empirical data regarding the behaviors of humans and other animals. Here, we report an experiment in which human subjects performed a sequential economic decision game in which the long-term optimal strategy differed from the strategy that leads to the greatest short-term return. We demonstrate that human subjects' performance in the task is significantly affected by the time between choices in a surprising and seemingly counterintuitive way. However, this behavior is naturally explained by a temporal difference learning model which includes ETs persisting across actions. Furthermore, we review recent findings that suggest that short-term synaptic plasticity in dopamine neurons may provide a realistic biophysical mechanism for producing ETs that persist on a timescale consistent with behavioral observations.},

title = {History- and current instruction-based coding of forthcoming behavioral outcomes in the striatum},
abstract = {Animals optimize behaviors by predicting future critical events based on histories of actions and their outcomes. When behavioral outcomes like reward and aversion are signaled by current external cues, actions are directed to acquire the reward and avoid the aversion. The basal ganglia are thought to be the brain locus for reward-based adaptive action planning and learning. To understand the role of striatum in coding outcomes of forthcoming behavioral responses, we addressed two specific questions. First, how are the histories of reward and aversion used for encoding forthcoming outcomes in the striatum during a series of instructed behavioral responses? Second, how are the behavioral responses and their instructed outcomes represented in the striatum? We recorded discharges of 163 presumed projection neurons in the striatum while monkeys performed a visually instructed lever-release task for reward, aversion, and sound outcomes, whose occurrences could be estimated by their histories. Before outcome instruction, discharge rates of a subset of neurons activated in this epoch showed positive or negative regression slopes with reward history (24/44), that is, to the number of trials since the last reward trial, which changed in parallel with reward probability of current trials. The history effect was also observed for the aversion outcome but in far fewer neurons (3/44). Once outcomes were instructed in the same task, neurons selectively encoded the outcomes before and after behavioral responses (reward, 46/70; aversion, 6/70; sound, 6/70). The history- and current instruction-based coding of forthcoming behavioral outcomes in the striatum might underlie outcome-oriented behavioral modulation.},

title = {Long-term reward prediction in TD models of the dopamine system},
abstract = {This article addresses the relationship between long-term reward predictions and slow-timescale neural activity in temporal difference (TD) models of the dopamine system. Such models attempt to explain how the activity of dopamine (DA) neurons relates to errors in the prediction of future rewards. Previous models have been mostly restricted to short-term predictions of rewards expected during a single, somewhat artificially defined trial. Also, the models focused exclusively on the phasic pause-and-burst activity of primate DA neurons; the neurons' slower, tonic background activity was assumed to be constant. This has led to difficulty in explaining the results of neurochemical experiments that measure indications of DA release on a slow timescale, results that seem at first glance inconsistent with a reward prediction model. In this article, we investigate a TD model of DA activity modified so as to enable it to make longer-term predictions about rewards expected far in the future. We show that these predictions manifest themselves as slow changes in the baseline error signal, which we associate with tonic DA activity. Using this model, we make new predictions about the behavior of the DA system in a number of experimental situations. Some of these predictions suggest new computational explanations for previously puzzling data, such as indications from microdialysis studies of elevated DA activity triggered by aversive events.},

title = {Modulation of Oncogenic Transcription and Alternative Splicing by \beta\-Catenin and an RNA Aptamer in Colon Cancer Cells},
abstract = {Activated \beta\-catenin regulates the transcription of oncogenic target genes and is critical for tumorigenesis. Because nuclear functions are frequently coupled, we investigated whether it also has a role in alternative splicing of oncogenic genes. We showed that stabilized \beta\-catenin caused alternative splicing of estrogen receptor-\beta\ pre-mRNA in colon cancer cells. To establish a direct role of \beta\-catenin in regulated splicing, we selected a high-affinity RNA aptamer that associated with \beta\-catenin in vivo. Nuclear localized aptamer inhibited \beta\-catenin-dependent transcription of cyclin D1 and c-myc in colon cancer cells; thus, cells stably expressing the aptamer exhibited cell cycle arrest and reduced tumor forming potential. Most significantly, the aptamer prevented the alternative splicing induced by stabilized \beta\-catenin. Taken together, our results establish that \beta\-catenin has an important role in both transcription and splicing, and that its action can be modulated by a high-affinity RNA aptamer. The RNA aptamer could be further developed as a specific inhibitor for cancer therapeutics. (Cancer Res 2006; 66(21): 10560-6)},

abstract = {Many monkeys adopt abstract response strategies as they learn to map visual symbols to responses by trial and error. According to the repeat-stay strategy, if a symbol repeats from a previous, successful trial, the monkeys should stay with their most recent response choice. According to the change-shift strategy, if the symbol changes, the monkeys should shift to a different choice. We recorded the activity of prefrontal cortex neurons while monkeys chose responses according to these two strategies. Many neurons had activity selective for the strategy used. In a subsequent block of trials, the monkeys learned fixed stimulus-response mappings with the same stimuli. Some neurons had activity selective for choosing responses based on fixed mappings, others for choosing based on abstract strategies. These findings indicate that the prefrontal cortex contributes to the implementation of the abstract response strategies that monkeys use during trial-and-error learning.},

title = {Testing basal ganglia motor functions through reversible inactivations in the posterior internal globus pallidus},
abstract = {To test current hypotheses on the contribution of the basal ganglia (BG) to motor control, we examined the effects of muscimol-induced inactivations in the skeletomotor region of the internal globus pallidus (sGPi) on visually directed reaching. Injections were made in two monkeys trained to perform four out-and-back reaching movements in quick succession toward four randomly selected target locations. Following sGPi inactivations the following occurred. 1) Peak velocity and acceleration were decreased in nearly all sessions, whereas movement duration lengthened inconsistently. 2) Reaction times were unaffected on average, although minor changes were observed in several individual sessions. 3) Outward reaches showed a substantial hypometria that correlated closely with bradykinesia, but directional accuracy was unaffected. 4) Endpoint accuracy was preserved for the slow visually guided return movements. 5) No impairments were found in the rapid chaining of out-and-back movements, in the selection or initiation of four independent reaches in quick succession or in the quick on-line correction of initially misdirected reaches. 6) Inactivation-induced reductions in the magnitude of movement-related muscle activity (EMG) correlated with the severity of slowing and hypometria. There was no evidence for inactivation-induced alterations in the relative timing of EMG bursts, excessive cocontraction, or impaired suppression of antagonist EMG. Therefore disconnecting the BG motor pathway consistently produced bradykinesia and hypometria, but seldom affected movement initiation time, feedback-mediated guidance, the capacity to produce iterative reaches, or the ability to abruptly reverse movement direction. These results are discussed with reference to the idea that the BG motor loop may regulate energetic expenditures during movement (i.e., movement "vigor").},

Because the number of potential reward values is very large, it is necessary that the brain's limited resources be allocated so as to discriminate better among more likely reward outcomes at the expense of less likely outcomes. We found that midbrain dopamine neurons rapidly adapted to the information provided by reward-predicting stimuli. Responses shifted relative to the expected reward value, and the gain adjusted to the variance of reward value. In this way, dopamine neurons maintained their reward sensitivity over a large range of reward values.},

title = {Indices for testing neural codes},
abstract = {One of the most critical challenges in systems neuroscience is determining the neural code. A principled framework for addressing this can be found in information theory. With this approach, one can determine whether a proposed code can account for the stimulus-response relationship. Specifically, one can compare the transmitted information between the stimulus and the hypothesized neural code with the transmitted information between the stimulus and the behavioral response. If the former is smaller than the latter (i.e., if the code cannot account for the behavior), the code can be ruled out. The information-theoretic index most widely used in this context is Shannon's mutual information. The Shannon test, however, is not ideal for this purpose: while the codes it will rule out are truly nonviable, there will be some nonviable codes that it will fail to rule out. Here we describe a wide range of alternative indices that can be used for ruling codes out. The range includes a continuum from Shannon information to measures of the performance of a Bayesian decoder. We analyze the relationship of these indices to each other and their complementary strengths and weaknesses for addressing this problem.},

We exploit these results to design a stable computational model of the cortico-baso-thalamo-cortical loops. Based on recent anatomical data, we include usually neglected neural projections, which participate in performing accurate selection. Finally, the efficiency of this model as an autonomous robot action selection mechanism is assessed in a standard survival task.

abstract = {Modeling of the basal ganglia has played a major role in our understanding of this elusive group of nuclei. Models of the basal ganglia have undergone evolutionary and revolutionary changes over the last 20 years, as new research in the fields of anatomy, physiology and biochemistry of these nuclei has yielded new information. Early models dealt with a single pathway through the nuclei and focused on the nature of the processing performed within it, convergence of information versus parallel processing of information. Later, the Albin-DeLong "box-and-arrow" model characterized the inter-nuclei interaction as multiple pathways while maintaining a simplistic scalar representation of the nuclei themselves. This model made a breakthrough by providing key insights into the behavior of these nuclei in hypo- and hyper-kinetic movement disorders. The next generation of models elaborated the intra-nuclei interactions and focused on the role of the basal ganglia in action selection and sequence generation which form the most current consensus regarding basal ganglia function in both normal and pathological conditions. However, new findings challenge these models and point to a different neural network approach to information processing in the basal ganglia. Here, we take an in-depth look at the reinforcement driven dimensionality reduction (RDDR) model which postulates that the basal ganglia compress cortical information according to a reinforcement signal using optimal extraction methods. The model provides new insights and experimental predictions on the computational capacity of the basal ganglia and their role in health and disease.},

title = {A dopaminergic axon lattice in the striatum and its relationship with cortical and thalamic terminals},
abstract = {Interactions between glutamatergic corticostriatal afferents and dopaminergic nigrostriatal afferents are central to basal ganglia function. The thalamostriatal projection provides a glutamatergic innervation of similar magnitude to the corticostriatal projection. We tested the hypotheses that (1) thalamostriatal synapses have similar spatial relationships with dopaminergic axons as corticostriatal synapses do and (2) the spatial relationships between excitatory synapses and dopaminergic axons are selective associations. We examined at the electron microscopic level rat striatum immunolabeled to reveal vesicular glutamate transporters (VGluTs) 1 and 2, markers of corticostriatal and thalamostriatal terminals, respectively, together with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) to reveal dopaminergic axons. Over 80% of VGluT-positive synapses were within 1 microm of a TH-positive axon and >40% were within 1 microm of a TH-positive synapse. Of structures postsynaptic to VGluT1- or VGluT2-positive terminals, 21 and 27%, respectively, were apposed by a TH-positive axon and about half of these made synaptic contact. When structures postsynaptic to VGluT-positive terminals and VGluT-positive terminals themselves were normalized for length of plasma membrane, the probability of them being apposed by, or in synaptic contact with, a TH-positive axon was similar to that of randomly selected structures. Extrapolation of the experimental data to more closely reflect the distribution in 3D reveals that all structures in the striatum are within approximately 1 microm of a TH-positive synapse. We conclude that (1) thalamostriatal synapses are in a position to be influenced by released dopamine to a similar degree as corticostriatal synapses are and (2) these associations arise from a nonselective dopaminergic axon lattice.},

abstract = {Models of natural action selection implicate fronto-striatal circuits in both motor and cognitive 'actions'. Dysfunction of these circuits leads to decision-making deficits in various populations. We review how computational models provide insights into the mechanistic basis for these deficits in Parkinson's patients and those with ventromedial frontal damage. We then consider implications of the models for understanding behaviour and cognition in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Incorporation of cortical noradrenaline function into the model improves action selection in noisy environments and accounts for response variability in ADHD. We close with more general clinical implications.},

title = {Modeling functions of striatal dopamine modulation in learning and planning},
abstract = {The activity of midbrain dopamine neurons is strikingly similar to the reward prediction error of temporal difference reinforcement learning models. Experimental evidence and simulation studies suggest that dopamine neuron activity serves as an effective reinforcement signal for learning of sensorimotor associations in striatal matrisomes. In the current study, we simulate dopamine neuron activity with the extended temporal difference model of Pavlovian learning and examine the influences of this signal on medium spiny neurons in striatal matrisomes. The modeled influences include transient membrane effects of dopamine D(1) receptor activation, dopamine-dependent long-term adaptations of corticostriatal transmission, and effects of dopamine on rhythmic fluctuations of the membrane potential between an elevated "up-state" and a hyperpolarized "down-state". The most dominant activity in the striatal matrisomes is assumed to elicit behaviors via projections from the basal ganglia to the thalamus and the cortex. This "standard model" performs successfully when tested for sensorimotor learning and goal-directed behavior (planning). To investigate the contributions of our model assumptions to learning and planning, we test the performance of several model variants that lack one of these mechanisms. These simulations show that the adaptation of the dopamine-like signal is necessary for sensorimotor learning and planning. Sensorimotor learning requires dopamine-dependent long-term adaptation of corticostriatal transmission. Lack of dopamine-like novelty responses decreases the number of exploratory acts, which impairs planning capabilities. The model loses its planning capabilities if the dopamine-like signal is simulated with the original temporal difference model, because the original temporal difference model does not form novel associative chains. Transient membrane effects of the dopamine-like signal on striatal firing substantially shorten the reaction time in the planning task. The capability for planning is improved by influences of dopamine on the durations of membrane potential fluctuations and by manipulations that prolong the reaction time of the model. These results suggest that responses of dopamine neurons to conditioned stimuli contribute to sensorimotor reward learning, novelty responses of dopamine neurons stimulate exploration, and transient dopamine membrane effects are important for planning.},

title = {Behavioral shifts and action valuation in the anterior cingulate cortex},
abstract = {Rapid optimization of behavior requires decisions about when to explore and when to exploit discovered resources. The mechanisms that lead to fast adaptations and their interaction with action valuation are a central issue. We show here that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) encodes multiple feedbacks devoted to exploration and its immediate termination. In a task that alternates exploration and exploitation periods, the ACC monitored negative and positive outcomes relevant for different adaptations. In particular, it produced signals specific of the first reward, i.e., the end of exploration. Those signals disappeared in exploitation periods but immediately transferred to the initiation of trials-a transfer comparable to learning phenomena observed for dopaminergic neurons. Importantly, these were also observed for high gamma oscillations of local field potentials shown to correlate with brain imaging signal. Thus, mechanisms of action valuation and monitoring of events/actions are combined for rapid behavioral regulation.},

title = {Anticipatory affect: neural correlates and consequences for choice},
abstract = {'Anticipatory affect' refers to emotional states that people experience while anticipating significant outcomes. Historically, technical limitations have made it difficult to determine whether anticipatory affect influences subsequent choice. Recent advances in the spatio-temporal resolution of functional magnetic resonance imaging, however, now allow researchers to visualize changes in neural activity seconds before choice occurs. We review evidence that activation in specific brain circuits changes during anticipation of monetary incentives, that this activation correlates with affective experience and that activity in these circuits may influence subsequent choice. Specifically, an activation likelihood estimate meta-analysis of cued response studies indicates that nucleus accumbens (NAcc) activation increases during gain anticipation relative to loss anticipation, while anterior insula activation increases during both loss and gain anticipation. Additionally, anticipatory NAcc activation correlates with self-reported positive arousal, whereas anterior insula activation correlates with both self-reported negative and positive arousal. Finally, NAcc activation precedes the purchase of desirable products and choice of high-risk gambles, whereas anterior insula activation precedes the rejection of overpriced products and choice of low-risk gambles. Together, these findings support a neurally plausible framework for understanding how anticipatory affect can influence choice.},

title = {Understanding the neural computations of arbitrary visuomotor learning through fMRI and associative learning theory},
abstract = {Associative theory postulates that learning the consequences of our actions in a given context is represented in the brain as stimulus-response-outcome associations that evolve according to prediction-error signals (the discrepancy between the observed and predicted outcome). We tested the theory on brain functional magnetic resonance imaging data acquired from human participants learning arbitrary visuomotor associations. We developed a novel task that systematically manipulated learning and induced highly reproducible performances. This granted the validation of the model-based results and an in-depth analysis of the brain signals in representative single trials. Consistent with the Rescorla-Wagner model, prediction-error signals are computed in the human brain and selectively engage the ventral striatum. In addition, we found evidence of computations not formally predicted by the Rescorla-Wagner model. The dorsal fronto-parietal network, the dorsal striatum, and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex are activated both on the incorrect and first correct trials and may reflect the processing of relevant visuomotor mappings during the early phases of learning. The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is selectively activated on the first correct outcome. The results provide quantitative evidence of the neural computations mediating arbitrary visuomotor learning and suggest new directions for future computational models.},

abstract = {The goal of pattern-based classification of functional neuroimaging data is to link individual brain activation patterns to the experimental conditions experienced during the scans. These "brain-reading" analyses advance functional neuroimaging on three fronts. From a technical standpoint, pattern-based classifiers overcome fatal f laws in the status quo inferential and exploratory multivariate approaches by combining pattern-based analyses with a direct link to experimental variables. In theoretical terms, the results that emerge from pattern-based classifiers can offer insight into the nature of neural representations. This shifts the emphasis in functional neuroimaging studies away from localizing brain activity toward understanding how patterns of brain activity encode information. From a practical point of view, pattern-based classifiers are already well established and understood in many areas of cognitive science. These tools are familiar to many researchers and provide a quantitatively sound and qualitatively satisfying answer to most questions addressed in functional neuroimaging studies. Here, we examine the theoretical, statistical, and practical underpinnings of pattern-based classification approaches to functional neuroimaging analyses. Pattern-based classification analyses are well positioned to become the standard approach to analyzing functional neuroimaging data.},

abstract = {The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) has been implicated in encoding whether or not an action is worth performing in view of the expected benefit and the cost of performing the action. Dopamine input to the ACC may be critical for this form of effort-based decision making; however, the role of distinct ACC dopamine receptors is yet unknown. Therefore, we examined in rats the effects of an intra-ACC D1 and D2 receptor blockade on effort-based decision making tested in a T-maze cost-benefit task. In this task, subjects could either choose to climb a barrier to obtain a high reward in one arm or a low reward in the other arm without a barrier. Unlike vehicle-treated rats, rats with intra-ACC infusion of the D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390 exhibited a reduced preference for the high-cost- high-reward response option when having the choice to obtain a low reward with little effort. In contrast, in rats with intra-ACC infusion of the D2 receptor antagonist eticlopride, the preference for the high-cost-high-reward response option was not altered relative to vehicle-treated rats. These data provide the first evidence that D1 receptors in the ACC regulate effort-based decision making.},

abstract = {Artificial grammar learning (Reber, 1967) is a form of implicit learning in which cognitive, rather than motor, implicit learning has been found. After viewing a series of letter strings formed according to a finite state rule system, people are able to classify new letter strings as to whether or not they are formed according to these grammatical rules despite little conscious insight into the rule structure. Previous research has shown that these classification judgments are based on knowledge of abstract rules as well as superficial similarity ("chunk strength") to training strings. Here we used event-related fMRI to identify neural regions involved in using both sources of information as test stimuli were designed to unconfound chunk strength from rule use. Using functional connectivity analyses, the extent to which the sources of information are complementary or competitive was also assessed. Activation in the right caudate was associated with rule adherence, whereas medial temporal lobe activations were associated with chunk strength. Additionally, functional connectivity analyses revealed caudate and medial temporal lobe activations to be strongly negatively correlated (r= -.88) with one another during the performance of this task.},

Whole-brain functional images acquired using a 1.5T scanner (General Electric, Milwaukee, WI) with gradient echo, echo planar imaging (3/1 mm; repetition time, 3000 ms; echo time, 50 ms) were analyzed using second-level random-effects procedures {\$}[{\$}SPM99 (Statistical Parametric Mapping){\$}]{\$}. Young and older adults displayed equivalent probabilistic category learning curves, used similar strategies, and activated analogous neural networks, including the prefrontal and parietal cortices and the caudate nucleus. However, the extent of caudate and prefrontal activation was less and parietal activation was greater in older participants. The percentage correct and reaction time were mainly positively correlated with caudate and prefrontal activation in young individuals but positively correlated with prefrontal and parietal cortices in older individuals. Differential activation within a circumscribed neural network in the context of equivalent learning suggests that some brain regions, such as the parietal cortices, may provide a compensatory mechanism for healthy older adults in the context of deficient prefrontal cortex and caudate nuclei responses.},

abstract = {The development of addiction involves a transition from casual to compulsive patterns of drug use. This transition to addiction is accompanied by many drug-induced changes in the brain and associated changes in psychological functions. In this article we present a critical analysis of the major theoretical explanations of how drug-induced alterations in psychological function might cause a transition to addiction. These include: (a) the traditional hedonic view that drug pleasure and subsequent unpleasant withdrawal symptoms are the chief causes of addiction; (b) the view that addiction is due to aberrant learning, especially the development of strong stimulus-response habits; (c) our incentive-sensitization view, which suggests that sensitization of a neural system that attributes incentive salience causes compulsive motivation or "wanting" to take addictive drugs; and (d) the idea that dysfunction of frontal cortical systems, which normally regulate decision making and inhibitory control over behavior, leads to impaired judgment and impulsivity in addicts.},

abstract = {This comment challenges the dichtotomy that Kriegeskorte and Bandettini (this issue) propose to exist between "activation-based" and "information-based" approaches to fMRI analyses and argues that multi-variate analyses are just a special case within the overall repertoire of methods for analyzing paradigm-related BOLD signal variations. Moreover, this comment argues that using multi-variate approaches comes at a price, trading-off spatial resolution for sensitivity, and thus partially cancels potential benefits from high-field fMRI. Paradoxically, this comment thus concludes that pattern analyses provide a powerful complement to existing methods but not the complement that will actually permit to map functional architecture at mesoscopic resolution, i.e., one of the most interesting applications of high-field fMRI.},

We provide evidence that two regions of the rat striatum, ventral and dorsal, play distinct roles in instrumental conditioning (skill learning), with the ventral striatum being critical for learning and the dorsal striatum being important for performance but, notably, not for learning. This implies an actor (dorsal) versus director (ventral) division of labor, which is a new variant of the widely discussed actor-critic architecture. Our results also imply that the successful performance of a skill can ultimately result in its establishment as a habit outside the basal ganglia.},

This multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) approach has led to several impressive feats of mind reading. More importantly, MVPA methods constitute a useful new tool for advancing our understanding of neural information processing. We review how researchers are using MVPA methods to characterize neural coding and information processing in domains ranging from visual perception to memory search.},

One emerging view is that information in WM is maintained via sensory recruitment, such that information is stored via sustained activity in the sensory areas that encode the to-be-remembered information. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we observed that key sensory regions such as primary visual cortex (V1) showed little evidence of sustained increases in mean activation during a WM delay period, though such amplitude increases have typically been used to determine whether a region is involved in on-line maintenance. However, a multivoxel pattern analysis of delay-period activity revealed a sustained pattern of activation in V1 that represented only the intentionally stored feature of a multifeature object. Moreover, the pattern of delay activity was qualitatively similar to that observed during the discrimination of sensory stimuli, suggesting that WM representations in V1 are reasonable "copies" of those evoked during pure sensory processing.},

abstract = {Modifications in the strengths of synapses are thought to underlie memory, learning, and development of cortical circuits. Many cellular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity have been investigated in which differential elevations of postsynaptic calcium concentrations play a key role in determining the direction and magnitude of synaptic changes. We have previously described a model of plasticity that uses calcium currents mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors as the associative signal for Hebbian learning. However, this model is not completely stable. Here, we propose a mechanism of stabilization through homeostatic regulation of intracellular calcium levels. With this model, synapses are stable and exhibit properties such as those observed in metaplasticity and synaptic scaling. In addition, the model displays synaptic competition, allowing structures to emerge in the synaptic space that reflect the statistical properties of the inputs. Therefore, the combination of a fast calcium-dependent learning and a slow stabilization mechanism can account for both the formation of selective receptive fields and the maintenance of neural circuits in a state of equilibrium.},

title = {A computational substrate for incentive salience},
abstract = {Theories of dopamine function are at a crossroads. Computational models derived from single-unit recordings capture changes in dopaminergic neuron firing rate as a prediction error signal. These models employ the prediction error signal in two roles: learning to predict future rewarding events and biasing action choice. Conversely, pharmacological inhibition or lesion of dopaminergic neuron function diminishes the ability of an animal to motivate behaviors directed at acquiring rewards. These lesion experiments have raised the possibility that dopamine release encodes a measure of the incentive value of a contemplated behavioral act. The most complete psychological idea that captures this notion frames the dopamine signal as carrying 'incentive salience'. On the surface, these two competing accounts of dopamine function seem incommensurate. To the contrary, we demonstrate that both of these functions can be captured in a single computational model of the involvement of dopamine in reward prediction for the purpose of reward seeking.},

title = {Lesch-Nyhan disease and the basal ganglia},
abstract = {The purpose of this review is to summarize emerging evidence that the neurobehavioral features of Lesch-Nyhan disease (LND), a developmental disorder caused by congenital deficiency of the purine salvage enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT), may be attributable to dysfunction of the basal ganglia. Affected individuals have severe motor disability described by prominent extrapyramidal features that are characteristic of dysfunction of the motor circuits of the basal ganglia. They also display disturbances of ocular motility, cognition, and behavioral control that may reflect disruption of other circuits of the basal ganglia. Though neuropathologic studies of autopsy specimens have revealed no obvious neuroanatomical abnormalities in LND, neurochemical studies have demonstrated 60-90% reductions in the dopamine content of the basal ganglia. In addition, recent PET studies have documented significant reductions in dopamine transporters and {\$}[{\$}18F{\$}]{\$}fluorodopa uptake in the basal ganglia. These findings support the proposal that many of the neurobehavioral features of LND might be related to dysfunction of the basal ganglia.},

title = {Statistical limitations in functional neuroimaging. I. Non-inferential methods and statistical models},
abstract = {Functional neuroimaging (FNI) provides experimental access to the intact living brain making it possible to study higher cognitive functions in humans. In this review and in a companion paper in this issue, we discuss some common methods used to analyse FNI data. The emphasis in both papers is on assumptions and limitations of the methods reviewed. There are several methods available to analyse FNI data indicating that none is optimal for all purposes. In order to make optimal use of the methods available it is important to know the limits of applicability. For the interpretation of FNI results it is also important to take into account the assumptions, approximations and inherent limitations of the methods used. This paper gives a brief overview over some non-inferential descriptive methods and common statistical models used in FNI. Issues relating to the complex problem of model selection are discussed. In general, proper model selection is a necessary prerequisite for the validity of the subsequent statistical inference. The non-inferential section describes methods that, combined with inspection of parameter estimates and other simple measures, can aid in the process of model selection and verification of assumptions. The section on statistical models covers approaches to global normalization and some aspects of univariate, multivariate, and Bayesian models. Finally, approaches to functional connectivity and effective connectivity are discussed. In the companion paper we review issues related to signal detection and statistical inference.},

title = {Human striatal responses to monetary reward depend on saliency},
abstract = {While the striatum has been implicated in reward processing, an alternative view contends that the striatum processes salient events in general. Using fMRI, we investigated human striatal responses to monetary reward while modulating the saliency surrounding its receipt. Money was maximally salient when its receipt depended on a correct response (active) and minimally salient when its receipt was completely independent of the task (passive). The saliency manipulation was confirmed by skin conductance responses and subjective ratings of the stimuli. Significant caudate and nucleus accumbens activations occurred following the active compared to passive money. Such activations were attributed to saliency rather than the motor requirement associated with the active money because striatal activations were not observed when the money was replaced by inconsequential, nonrewarding stimuli. The present study provides evidence that the striatum's role in reward processing is dependent on the saliency associated with reward, rather than value or hedonic feelings.},

abstract = {The discovery of dopamine as a neurotransmitter in brain by Arvid Carlsson approximately 50 years ago, and the subsequent insight provided by Paul Greengard into the cellular signalling mechanisms triggered by dopamine, gained these researchers the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2000. Dopamine research has had a greater impact on the development of biological psychiatry and psychopharmacology than work on any other neurotransmitter. Neuropsychological views of the role of dopamine in the CNS have evolved from that of a simple reward signal to a more complex situation in which dopamine encodes the importance or `salience' of events in the external world. Hypofunctional dopamine states underlie Parkinson's disease and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and there is increasing evidence for dopamine hyperactivity in schizophrenia. Some of the medicines that are most widely used in psychiatry, such as L-DOPA, methylphenidate and neuroleptic drugs, act on dopaminergic mechanisms.},

title = {Inferring neural activity from BOLD signals through nonlinear optimization},
abstract = {The blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI signal does not measure neuronal activity directly. This fact is a key concern for interpreting functional imaging data based on BOLD. Mathematical models describing the path from neural activity to the BOLD response allow us to numerically solve the inverse problem of estimating the timing and amplitude of the neuronal activity underlying the BOLD signal. In fact, these models can be viewed as an advanced substitute for the impulse response function. In this work, the issue of estimating the dynamics of neuronal activity from the observed BOLD signal is considered within the framework of optimization problems. The model is based on the extended "balloon" model and describes the conversion of neuronal signals into the BOLD response through the transitional dynamics of the blood flow-inducing signal, cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume and deoxyhemoglobin concentration. Global optimization techniques are applied to find a control input (the neuronal activity and/or the biophysical parameters in the model) that causes the system to follow an admissible solution to minimize discrepancy between model and experimental data. As an alternative to a local linearization (LL) filtering scheme, the optimization method escapes the linearization of the transition system and provides a possibility to search for the global optimum, avoiding spurious local minima. We have found that the dynamics of the neural signals and the physiological variables as well as the biophysical parameters can be robustly reconstructed from the BOLD responses. Furthermore, it is shown that spiking off/on dynamics of the neural activity is the natural mathematical solution of the model. Incorporating, in addition, the expansion of the neural input by smooth basis functions, representing a low-pass filtering, allows us to model local field potential (LFP) solutions instead of spiking solutions.},

abstract = {The mesocorticolimbic dopamine system is essential for cognitive and emotive brain functions and is thus an important target in major brain diseases like schizophrenia, drug addiction, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. However, the cellular basis for the diversity in behavioral functions and associated dopamine-release pattern within the mesocorticolimbic system has remained unclear. Here, we report the identification of a type of dopaminergic neuron within the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system with unconventional fast-firing properties and small DAT/TH mRNA expression ratios that selectively projects to prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens core and medial shell as well as to basolateral amygdala. In contrast, well-described conventional slow-firing dopamine midbrain neurons only project to the lateral shell of the nucleus accumbens and the dorsolateral striatum. Among this dual dopamine midbrain system defined in this study by converging anatomical, electrophysiological, and molecular properties, mesoprefrontal dopaminergic neurons are unique, as only they do not possess functional somatodendritic Girk2-coupled dopamine D2 autoreceptors.},

Rats were given NMDA lesions of the dorsolateral striatum (DLS), anterior dorsomedial striatum (ADMS), posterior dorsomedial striatum (PDMS), or sham surgery. They were then trained to retrieve food from the west arm of the maze, starting from the south arm, by turning left at the choice point. After 7 d of training, with four trials a day, a probe test was given in which the starting arm is inserted as the north arm, at the opposite side of the maze. A left turn would indicate a "response" strategy; a right turn, a "place" strategy. The rats were then trained for 7 more days, followed by a second probe test. Unlike rats in the other groups, most of the rats in the PDMS group turned left, using the response strategy on both probe tests. These results suggest that the PDMS plays a role in spatially guided behavior.},

title = {Real-time fMRI using brain-state classification},
abstract = {We have implemented a real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging system based on multivariate classification. This approach is distinctly different from spatially localized real-time implementations, since it does not require prior assumptions about functional localization and individual performance strategies, and has the ability to provide feedback based on intuitive translations of brain state rather than localized fluctuations. Thus this approach provides the capability for a new class of experimental designs in which real-time feedback control of the stimulus is possible-rather than using a fixed paradigm, experiments can adaptively evolve as subjects receive brain-state feedback. In this report, we describe our implementation and characterize its performance capabilities. We observed approximately 80% classification accuracy using whole brain, block-design, motor data. Within both left and right motor task conditions, important differences exist between the initial transient period produced by task switching (changing between rapid left or right index finger button presses) and the subsequent stable period during sustained activity. Further analysis revealed that very high accuracy is achievable during stable task periods, and that the responsiveness of the classifier to changes in task condition can be much faster than signal time-to-peak rates. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of this implementation with respect to behavioral task, suggesting that our results are applicable across a spectrum of cognitive domains. Beyond basic research, this technology can complement electroencephalography-based brain computer interface research, and has potential applications in the areas of biofeedback rehabilitation, lie detection, learning studies, virtual reality-based training, and enhanced conscious awareness.},

We examined this in monkeys performing an oculomotor choice task. The activity of phasically active neurons (PANs) in the striatum covaried with two classes of information: action-values and chosen-values. Action-value PANs were correlated with value estimates for one of the available actions, and these signals were frequently observed before movement execution. Chosen-value PANs were correlated with the value of the action that had been chosen, and these signals were primarily observed later in the task, immediately before or persistently after movement execution. These populations may serve distinct functions mediated by the striatum: some PANs may participate in choice by encoding the values of the available actions, while other PANs may participate in evaluative updating by encoding the reward value of chosen actions.},

abstract = {Deciding advantageously in a complex situation is thought to require overt reasoning on declarative knowledge, namely, on facts pertaining to premises, options for action, and outcomes of actions that embody the pertinent previous experience. An alternative possibility was investigated: that overt reasoning is preceded by a nonconscious biasing step that uses neural systems other than those that support declarative knowledge. Normal participants and patients with prefrontal damage and decision-making defects performed a gambling task in which behavioral, psychophysiological, and self-account measures were obtained in parallel. Normals began to choose advantageously before they realized which strategy worked best, whereas prefrontal patients continued to choose disadvantageously even after they knew the correct strategy. Moreover, normals began to generate anticipatory skin conductance responses (SCRs) whenever they pondered a choice that turned out to be risky, before they knew explicitly that it was a risky choice, whereas patients never developed anticipatory SCRs, although some eventually realized which choices were risky. The results suggest that, in normal individuals, nonconscious biases guide behavior before conscious knowledge does. Without the help of such biases, overt knowledge may be insufficient to ensure advantageous behavior.},

title = {Key Concepts in Model Selection: Performance and Generalizability},
abstract = {What is model selection? What are the goals of model selection? What are the methods of model selection and how do they work? Which methods perform better than others and in what circumstances? These questions rest on a number of key concepts in a relatively underdeveloped field. The aim of this paper is to explain some background concepts, to highlight some of the results in this special issue, and to add my own. The standard methods of model selection include classical hypothesis testing, maximum likelihood, Bayes method, minimum description length, cross-validation, and Akaike's information criterion. They all provide an implementation of Occam's razor, in which parsimony or simplicity is balanced against goodness-of-fit. These methods primarily take account of the sampling errors in parameter estimation, although their relative success at this task depends on the circumstances. However, the aim of model selection should also include the ability of a model to generalize to predictions in a different domain. Errors of extrapolation, or generalization, are different from errors of parameter estimation. So, it seems that simplicity and parsimony may be an additional factor in managing these errors, in which case the standard methods of model selection are incomplete implementations of Occam's razor.

title = {Quantifying variability in neural responses and its application for the validation of model predictions},
abstract = {A rate code assumes that a neuron's response is completely characterized by its time-varying mean firing rate. This assumption has successfully described neural responses in many systems. The noise in rate coding neurons can be quantified by the coherence function or the correlation coefficient between the neuron's deterministic time-varying mean rate and noise corrupted single spike trains. Because of the finite data size, the mean rate cannot be known exactly and must be approximated. We introduce novel unbiased estimators for the measures of coherence and correlation which are based on the extrapolation of the signal to noise ratio in the neural response to infinite data size. We then describe the application of these estimates to the validation of the class of stimulus-response models that assume that the mean firing rate captures all the information embedded in the neural response. We explain how these quantifiers can be used to separate response prediction errors that are due to inaccurate model assumptions from errors due to noise inherent in neuronal spike trains.},

title = {Reinforcement learning of motor skills with policy gradients},
abstract = {Autonomous learning is one of the hallmarks of human and animal behavior, and understanding the principles of learning will be crucial in order to achieve true autonomy in advanced machines like humanoid robots. In this paper, we examine learning of complex motor skills with human-like limbs. While supervised learning can offer useful tools for bootstrapping behavior, e.g., by learning from demonstration, it is only reinforcement learning that offers a general approach to the final trial-and-error improvement that is needed by each individual acquiring a skill. Neither neurobiological nor machine learning studies have, so far, offered compelling results on how reinforcement learning can be scaled to the high-dimensional continuous state and action spaces of humans or humanoids. Here, we combine two recent research developments on learning motor control in order to achieve this scaling. First, we interpret the idea of modular motor control by means of motor primitives as a suitable way to generate parameterized control policies for reinforcement learning. Second, we combine motor primitives with the theory of stochastic policy gradient learning, which currently seems to be the only feasible framework for reinforcement learning for humanoids. We evaluate different policy gradient methods with a focus on their applicability to parameterized motor primitives. We compare these algorithms in the context of motor primitive learning, and show that our most modern algorithm, the Episodic Natural Actor-Critic outperforms previous algorithms by at least an order of magnitude. We demonstrate the efficiency of this reinforcement learning method in the application of learning to hit a baseball with an anthropomorphic robot arm.},

title = {The quantitative evaluation of functional neuroimaging experiments: the NPAIRS data analysis framework},
abstract = {We introduce a data-analysis framework and performance metrics for evaluating and optimizing the interaction between activation tasks, experimental designs, and the methodological choices and tools for data acquisition, preprocessing, data analysis, and extraction of statistical parametric maps (SPMs). Our NPAIRS (nonparametric prediction, activation, influence, and reproducibility resampling) framework provides an alternative to simulations and ROC curves by using real PET and fMRI data sets to examine the relationship between prediction accuracy and the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) associated with reproducible SPMs. Using cross-validation resampling we plot training-test set predictions of the experimental design variables (e.g., brain-state labels) versus reproducibility SNR metrics for the associated SPMs. We demonstrate the utility of this framework across the wide range of performance metrics obtained from [(15)O]water PET studies of 12 age- and sex-matched data sets performing different motor tasks (8 subjects/set). For the 12 data sets we apply NPAIRS with both univariate and multivariate data-analysis approaches to: (1) demonstrate that this framework may be used to obtain reproducible SPMs from any data-analysis approach on a common Z-score scale (rSPM[Z]); (2) demonstrate that the histogram of a rSPM[Z] image may be modeled as the sum of a data-analysis-dependent noise distribution and a task-dependent, Gaussian signal distribution that scales monotonically with our reproducibility performance metric; (3) explore the relation between prediction and reproducibility performance metrics with an emphasis on bias-variance tradeoffs for flexible, multivariate models; and (4) measure the broad range of reproducibility SNRs and the significant influence of individual subjects. A companion paper describes learning curves for four of these 12 data sets, which describe an alternative mutual-information prediction metric and NPAIRS reproducibility as a function of training-set sizes from 2 to 18 subjects. We propose the NPAIRS framework as a validation tool for testing and optimizing methodological choices and tools in functional neuroimaging.},

title = {Ventral striatal neurons encode the value of the chosen action in rats deciding between differently delayed or sized rewards},
abstract = {The ventral striatum (VS) is thought to serve as a gateway whereby associative information from the amygdala and prefrontal regions can influence motor output to guide behavior. If VS mediates this "limbic-motor" interface, then one might expect neural correlates in VS to reflect this information. Specifically, neural activity should reflect the integration of motivational value with subsequent behavior. To test this prediction, we recorded from single units in VS while rats performed a choice task in which different odor cues indicated that reward was available on the left or on the right. The value of reward associated with a left or rightward movement was manipulated in separate blocks of trials by either varying the delay preceding reward delivery or by changing reward size. Rats' behavior was influenced by the value of the expected reward and the response required to obtain it, and activity in the majority of cue-responsive VS neurons reflected the integration of these two variables. Unlike similar cue-evoked activity reported previously in dopamine neurons, these correlates were only observed if the directional response was subsequently executed. Furthermore, activity was correlated with the speed at which the rats' executed the response. These results are consistent with the notion that VS serves to integrate information about the value of an expected reward with motor output during decision making.},

abstract = {Human and animal decisions are modulated by a variety of environmental and intrinsic contexts. Here I consider computational factors that can affect decision making and review anatomical structures and neurochemical systems that are related to contextual modulation of decision making. Expectation of a high reward can motivate a subject to go for an action despite a large cost, a decision that is influenced by dopamine in the anterior cingulate cortex. Uncertainty of action outcomes can promote risk taking and exploratory choices, in which norepinephrine and the orbitofrontal cortex appear to be involved. Predictable environments should facilitate consideration of longer-delayed rewards, which depends on serotonin in the dorsal striatum and dorsal prefrontal cortex. This article aims to sort out factors that affect the process of decision making from the viewpoint of reinforcement learning theory and to bridge between such computational needs and their neurophysiological substrates.},

title = {Human striatal response to salient nonrewarding stimuli},
abstract = {Although one proposed function of both the striatum and its major dopamine inputs is related to coding rewards and reward-related stimuli, an alternative view suggests a more general role of the striatum in processing salient events, regardless of their reward value. Here we define saliency as an event that both is unexpected and elicits an attentional-behavioral switch (i.e., arousing). In the present study, human striatal responses to nonrewarding salient stimuli were investigated. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the blood oxygenation level-dependent signal was measured in response to flickering visual distractors presented in the background of an ongoing task. Distractor salience was manipulated by altering the frequency of distractor occurrence. Infrequently presented distractors were considered more salient than frequently presented distractors. We also investigated whether behavioral relevance of the distractors was a necessary component of saliency for eliciting striatal responses. In the first experiment (19 subjects), the distractors were made behaviorally relevant by defining a subset of them as targets requiring a button press. In the second experiment (17 subjects), the distractors were not behaviorally relevant (i.e., they did not require any response). The fMRI results revealed increased activation in the nucleus accumbens after infrequent (high salience) relative to frequent (low salience) presentation of distractors in both experiments. Caudate activity increased only when the distractors were behaviorally relevant. These results demonstrate a role of the striatum in coding nonrewarding salient events. In addition, a functional subdivision of the striatum according to the behavioral relevance of the stimuli is suggested.},

abstract = {Animal research and human brain imaging findings suggest that reward processing involves distinct anticipation and outcome phases. Error terms in popular models of reward learning (such as the temporal difference [TD] model) do not distinguish between the updating of expectations in response to reward cues and outcomes. Thus, correlating a single error term with neural activation assumes recruitment of similar neural substrates at each update. Here, we split the error term to separately model reward prediction and prediction errors, and compare the fit of single versus split error terms to functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) data acquired during a monetary incentive delay task. We speculate and find that while the nucleus accumbens computes gain prediction in response to cues, the mesial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) computes gain prediction errors in response to outcomes. In addition to offering a more comprehensive and anatomically situated view of reward processing, split error terms generate novel predictions about psychiatric symptoms and lesion-induced deficits.},

Distinct areas of the OFC were activated by monetary rewards and punishments. Moreover, in these areas, we found a correlation between the magnitude of the brain activation and the magnitude of the rewards and punishments received.

title = {Statistical methods of estimation and inference for functional MR image analysis},
abstract = {Two questions arising in the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired during periodic sensory stimulation are: i) how to measure the experimentally determined effect in fMRI time series; and ii) how to decide whether an apparent effect is significant. Our approach is first to fit a time series regression model, including sine and cosine terms at the (fundamental) frequency of experimental stimulation, by pseudogeneralized least squares (PGLS) at each pixel of an image. Sinusoidal modeling takes account of locally variable hemodynamic delay and dispersion, and PGLS fitting corrects for residual or endogenous autocorrelation in fMRI time series, to yield best unbiased estimates of the amplitudes of the sine and cosine terms at fundamental frequency; from these parameters the authors derive estimates of experimentally determined power and its standard error. Randomization testing is then used to create inferential brain activation maps (BAMs) of pixels significantly activated by the experimental stimulus. The methods are illustrated by application to data acquired from normal human subjects during periodic visual and auditory stimulation.},

Among them, the dopaminergic system is believed to play a role in the self-injurious behavior through receptor supersensitivity. However, the precise mechanism underlying the dopamine supersensitivity remains unclear. An increased serotonergic action in the striatum may be crucial for the appearance of self-injurious behavior, and pharmacological evidence suggests the efficacy of serotonin agonists/antagonists for the treatment of the self-mutilation in LNS.},

title = {Modifications of reward expectation-related neuronal activity during learning in primate orbitofrontal cortex},
abstract = {This study investigated how neuronal activity in orbitofrontal cortex related to the expectation of reward changed while monkeys repeatedly learned to associate new instruction pictures with known behavioral reactions and reinforcers. In a delayed go-nogo task with several trial types, an initial picture instructed the animal to execute or withhold a reaching movement and to expect a liquid reward or a conditioned auditory reinforcer. When novel instruction pictures were presented, animals learned according to a trial-and-error strategy. After experience with a large number of novel pictures, learning occurred in a few trials, and correct performance usually exceeded 70% in the first 60-90 trials. About 150 task-related neurons in orbitofrontal cortex were studied in both familiar and learning conditions and showed two major forms of changes during learning. Quantitative changes of responses to the initial instruction were seen as appearance of new responses, increase of existing responses, or decrease or complete disappearance of responses. The changes usually outlasted initial learning trials and persisted during subsequent consolidation. They often modified the trial selectivities of activations. Increases might reflect the increased attention during learning and induce neuronal changes underlying the behavioral adaptations. Decreases might be related to the unreliable reward-predicting value of frequently changing learning instructions. The second form of changes reflected the adaptation of reward expectations during learning. In initial learning trials, animals reacted as if they expected liquid reward in every trial type, although only two of the three trial types were rewarded with liquid. In close correspondence, neuronal activations related to the expectation of reward occurred initially in every trial type. The behavioral indices for reward expectation and their neuronal correlates adapted in parallel during the course of learning and became restricted to rewarded trials. In conclusion, these data support the notion that neurons in orbitofrontal cortex code reward information in a flexible and adaptive manner during behavioral changes after novel stimuli.},

abstract = {Machine learning and pattern recognition techniques are being increasingly employed in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data analysis. By taking into account the full spatial pattern of brain activity measured simultaneously at many locations, these methods allow detecting subtle, non-strictly localized effects that may remain invisible to the conventional analysis with univariate statistical methods. In typical fMRI applications, pattern recognition algorithms "learn" a functional relationship between brain response patterns and a perceptual, cognitive or behavioral state of a subject expressed in terms of a label, which may assume discrete (classification) or continuous (regression) values. This learned functional relationship is then used to predict the unseen labels from a new data set ("brain reading"). In this article, we describe the mathematical foundations of machine learning applications in fMRI. We focus on two methods, support vector machines and relevance vector machines, which are respectively suited for the classification and regression of fMRI patterns. Furthermore, by means of several examples and applications, we illustrate and discuss the methodological challenges of using machine learning algorithms in the context of fMRI data analysis.},

abstract = {Much is known about how people make decisions under varying levels of probability (risk). Less is known about the neural basis of decision-making when probabilities are uncertain because of missing information (ambiguity). In decision theory, ambiguity about probabilities should not affect choices. Using functional brain imaging, we show that the level of ambiguity in choices correlates positively with activation in the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex, and negatively with a striatal system. Moreover, striatal activity correlates positively with expected reward. Neurological subjects with orbitofrontal lesions were insensitive to the level of ambiguity and risk in behavioral choices. These data suggest a general neural circuit responding to degrees of uncertainty, contrary to decision theory.},

abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated that spatial patterns of fMRI BOLD activity distribution over the brain may be used to classify different groups or mental states. These studies are based on the application of advanced pattern recognition approaches and multivariate statistical classifiers. Most published articles in this field are focused on improving the accuracy rates and many approaches have been proposed to accomplish this task. Nevertheless, a point inherent to most machine learning methods (and still relatively unexplored in neuroimaging) is how the discriminative information can be used to characterize groups and their differences. In this work, we introduce the Maximum Uncertainty Linear Discrimination Analysis (MLDA) and show how it can be applied to infer groups' patterns by discriminant hyperplane navigation. In addition, we show that it naturally defines a behavioral score, i.e., an index quantifying the distance between the states of a subject from predefined groups. We validate and illustrate this approach using a motor block design fMRI experiment data with 35 subjects.},

The cortical substrates that mediate this function, however, have not been identified in humans. To identify brain regions involved in stimulus categorization, we developed a task in which subjects classified stimuli according to a variable categorical boundary. Psychophysical functions were used to define a decision variable, categorization uncertainty, which was systematically manipulated. Using event-related functional MRI, we discovered that activity in a fronto-striatal-thalamic network, consisting of the medial frontal gyrus, anterior insula, ventral striatum, and dorsomedial thalamus, was modulated by categorization uncertainty. We found this network to be distinct from the frontoparietal attention network, consisting of the frontal and parietal eye fields, where activity was not correlated with categorization uncertainty.},

This form of memory includes the ability to quickly establish novel associations between unrelated items. To better understand the patterns of neural activity during associative memory formation, we re- corded the activity of hippocampal neurons of macaque monkeys as they learned new associations. Hippocampal neurons signaled learning by changing their stimulus-selective response properties. This change in the pattern of selective neural activity occurred before, at the same time as, or after learning, which suggests that these neurons are involved in the initial formation of new associative memories.},

They stuck a set of electrode in two Macaques, and monitored hippo cells during learning and rest. The monitoring points were distributed throughout the hippo, but did not extend in the fornix or the surrounding cortex.

A bimodal distribution of firing rates was observed (labeled as fast and slow).  Interestingly, the firing rate increase or decreased in response to learning and the change in rate occurred at various times for the ~90 cells monitored, suggesting that there is a gradual recruitment of cells during learning.  

The big point:  changes in firing rate were tightly correlated to learning.

title = {Basal ganglia orient eyes to reward},
abstract = {Expectation of reward motivates our behaviors and influences our decisions. Indeed, neuronal activity in many brain areas is modulated by expected reward. However, it is still unclear where and how the reward-dependent modulation of neuronal activity occurs and how the reward-modulated signal is transformed into motor outputs. Recent studies suggest an important role of the basal ganglia. Sensorimotor/cognitive activities of neurons in the basal ganglia are strongly modulated by expected reward. Through their abundant outputs to the brain stem motor areas and the thalamocortical circuits, the basal ganglia appear capable of producing body movements based on expected reward. A good behavioral measure to test this hypothesis is saccadic eye movement because its brain stem mechanism has been extensively studied. Studies from our laboratory suggest that the basal ganglia play a key role in guiding the gaze to the location where reward is available. Neurons in the caudate nucleus and the substantia nigra pars reticulata are extremely sensitive to the positional difference in expected reward, which leads to a bias in excitability between the superior colliculi such that the saccade to the to-be-rewarded position occurs more quickly. It is suggested that the reward modulation occurs in the caudate where cortical inputs carrying spatial signals and dopaminergic inputs carrying reward-related signals are integrated. These data support a specific form of reinforcement learning theories, but also suggest further refinement of the theory.},

Self-mutilative behavior is a hallmark of the disease. Hyperuricemia leads to hyperuricuria and uric acid nephrolithiasis. The underlying defect is a deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine-phosphoribosyl transferase. We report on a 7-year-old boy with Lesch--Nyhan syndrome, lacking self-mutilative behavior, who was erroneously diagnosed as having athetotic cerebral palsy. He also had no renal stones; hyperechoic renal medullary pyramids were the only renal abnormality detected and were sonographically indistinguishable from medullary nephrocalcinosis.},

title = {Anticipatory haemodynamic signals in sensory cortex not predicted by local neuronal activity},
abstract = {Haemodynamic signals underlying functional brain imaging (for example, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)) are assumed to reflect metabolic demand generated by local neuronal activity, with equal increases in haemodynamic signal implying equal increases in the underlying neuronal activity. Few studies have compared neuronal and haemodynamic signals in alert animals to test for this assumed correspondence. Here we present evidence that brings this assumption into question. Using a dual-wavelength optical imaging technique that independently measures cerebral blood volume and oxygenation, continuously, in alert behaving monkeys, we find two distinct components to the haemodynamic signal in the alert animals' primary visual cortex (V1). One component is reliably predictable from neuronal responses generated by visual input. The other component-of almost comparable strength-is a hitherto unknown signal that entrains to task structure independently of visual input or of standard neural predictors of haemodynamics. This latter component shows predictive timing, with increases of cerebral blood volume in anticipation of trial onsets even in darkness. This trial-locked haemodynamic signal could be due to an accompanying V1 arterial pumping mechanism, closely matched in time, with peaks of arterial dilation entrained to predicted trial onsets. These findings (tested in two animals) challenge the current understanding of the link between brain haemodynamics and local neuronal activity. They also suggest the existence of a novel preparatory mechanism in the brain that brings additional arterial blood to cortex in anticipation of expected tasks.},

abstract = {The hippocampus and the basal ganglia are thought to play fundamental and distinct roles in learning and memory, supporting two dissociable memory systems. Interestingly, however, the hippocampus and the basal ganglia have each, separately, been implicated as necessary for reversal learning---the ability to adaptively change a response when previously learned stimulus--outcome contingencies are reversed. Here, we compared the contribution of the hippocampus and the basal ganglia to distinct aspects of learning and reversal. Amnesic subjects with selective hippocampal damage, Parkinson subjects with disrupted basal ganglia function, and healthy controls were tested on a novel probabilistic learning and reversal paradigm. In this task, reversal can be achieved in two ways: Subjects can reverse a previously learned response, or they can select a new cue during the reversal phase, effectively ``opting out'' of the reversal. We found that both patient groups were intact at initial learning, but differed in their ab...},

Yet, it has been argued that NAcc activation to aversive stimuli may be a consequence of the rewarding effects of their termination, i.e., relief. To address this question we used fMRI to delineate brain response to the onset and offset of unpleasant and pleasant auditory stimuli in the absence of learning or motor response. Increased NAcc activity was seen for the onset of both pleasant and unpleasant stimuli. Our results support the expanded bivalent view of NAcc function and call for expansion of current models of NAcc function that are solely focused on reward.},

Nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, NT-4/5, and corresponding antibodies dramatically modify the development of the visual cortex. Although the neuronal elements involved have not yet been identified, complementary studies of other systems have demonstrated that NT synthesis is rapidly regulated by neuronal activity and that NTs are released in an activity-dependent manner from neuronal dendrites. These data, together with the observation that NTs enhance transmitter release from neurons that express the corresponding signal-transducing Trk receptors, suggest a role for NTs as selective retrograde messengers that regulate synaptic efficacy.},

abstract = {Behavioral studies have long shown that humans solve problems in two ways, one intuitive and fast (System 1, model-free), and the other reflective and slow (System 2, model-based). The neurobiological basis of dual process problem solving remains unknown due to challenges of separating activation in concurrent systems. We present a novel neuroeconomic task that predicts distinct subjective valuation and updating signals corresponding to these two systems. We found two concurrent value signals in human prefrontal cortex: a System 1 model-free reinforcement signal and a System 2 model-based Bayesian signal. We also found a System 1 updating signal in striatal areas and a System 2 updating signal in lateral prefrontal cortex. Further, signals in prefrontal cortex preceded choices that are optimal according to either updating principle, while signals in anterior cingulate cortex and globus pallidus preceded deviations from optimal choice for reinforcement learning. These deviations tended to occur when uncertainty regarding optimal values was highest, suggesting that disagreement between dual systems is mediated by uncertainty rather than conflict, confirming recent theoretical proposals.},

title = {Human striatal activation during adjustment of the response criterion in visual word recognition},
abstract = {Results of recent computational modelling studies suggest that a general function of the striatum in human cognition is related to shifting decision criteria in selection processes. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 21 healthy subjects to examine the hemodynamic responses when subjects shift their response criterion on a trial-by-trial basis in the lexical decision paradigm. Trial-by-trial criterion setting is obtained when subjects respond faster in trials following a word trial than in trials following nonword trials - irrespective of the lexicality of the current trial. Since selection demands are equally high in the current trials, we expected to observe neural activations that are related to response criterion shifting. The behavioural data show sequential effects with faster responses in trials following word trials compared to trials following nonword trials, suggesting that subjects shifted their response criterion on a trial-by-trial basis. The neural responses revealed a signal increase in the striatum only in trials following word trials. This striatal activation is therefore likely to be related to response criterion setting. It demonstrates a role of the striatum in shifting decision criteria in visual word recognition, which cannot be attributed to pure error-related processing or the selection of a preferred response.},

abstract = {Visual imagery is mediated via top-down activation of visual cortex. Similar to stimulus-driven perception, the neural configurations associated with visual imagery are differentiated according to content. For example, imagining faces or places differentially activates visual areas associated with perception of actual face or place stimuli. However, while top-down activation of topographically specific visual areas during visual imagery is well established, the extent to which internally generated visual activity resembles the fine-scale population coding responsible for stimulus-driven perception remains unknown. Here, we sought to determine whether top-down mechanisms can selectively activate perceptual representations coded across spatially overlapping neural populations. We explored the precision of top-down activation of perceptual representations using neural pattern classification to identify activation patterns associated with imagery of distinct letter stimuli. Pattern analysis of the neural population observed within high-level visual cortex, including lateral occipital complex, revealed that imagery activates the same neural representations that are activated by corresponding visual stimulation. We conclude that visual imagery is mediated via top-down activation of functionally distinct, yet spatially overlapping population codes for high-level visual representations.},

title = {Cholinergic Interneurons Control the Excitatory Input to the Striatum},
abstract = {How the extent and time course of presynaptic inhibition depend on the action potentials of the neuron controlling the terminals is unknown. We investigated this issue in the striatum using paired recordings from cholinergic interneurons and projection neurons. Glutamatergic EPSCs were evoked in projection neurons and cholinergic interneurons by stimulation of afferent fibers in the cortex and the striatum, respectively. A single spike in a cholinergic interneuron caused significant depression of the evoked glutamatergic EPSC in 34% of projection neurons located within 100 microm and 41% of cholinergic interneurons located within 200 microm. The time course of these effects was similar in the two cases, with EPSC inhibition peaking 20-30 ms after the spike and disappearing after 40-80 ms. Maximal depression of EPSC amplitude was up to 27% in projection neurons and to 19% in cholinergic interneurons. These effects were reversibly blocked by muscarinic receptor antagonists (atropine or methoctramine), which also significantly increased baseline EPSC (evoked without a preceding spike in the cholinergic interneuron), suggesting that some tonic cholinergic presynaptic inhibition was present. This was confirmed by the fact that lowering extracellular potassium, which silenced spontaneously active cholinergic interneurons, also increased baseline EPSC amplitude, and these effects were occluded by previous application of muscarinic receptor antagonists. Collectively, these results show that a single spike in a cholinergic interneuron exerts a fast and powerful inhibitory control over the glutamatergic input to striatal neurons.},

title = {Detection of time-varying signals in event-related fMRI designs},
abstract = {In neuroimaging research on attention, cognitive control, decision-making, and other areas where response time (RT) is a critical variable, the temporal variability associated with the decision is often assumed to be inconsequential to the hemodynamic response (HDR) in rapid event-related designs. On this basis, the majority of published studies model brain activity lasting less than 4 s with brief impulses representing the onset of neural or cognitive events, which are then convolved with the hemodynamic impulse response function (HRF). However, electrophysiological studies have shown that decision-related neuronal activity is not instantaneous, but in fact, often lasts until the motor response. It is therefore possible that small differences in neural processing durations, similar to human RTs, will produce noticeable changes in the HDR, and therefore in the results of regression analyses. In this study we compare the effectiveness of traditional models that assume no temporal variance with a model that explicitly accounts for the duration of very brief epochs of neural activity. Using both simulations and fMRI data, we show that brief differences in duration are detectable, making it possible to dissociate the effects of stimulus intensity from stimulus duration, and that optimizing the model for the type of activity being detected improves the statistical power, consistency, and interpretability of results.},

abstract = {We investigated the neural representation of observed actions in the human parietal and premotor cortex, which comprise the action observation network or the mirror neuron system for action recognition. Participants observed object-directed hand actions, in which action as well as other properties were independently manipulated: action (grasp or touch), object (cup or bottle), perspective (1st or 3rd person), hand (right or left), and image size (large or small). We then used multi-voxel pattern analysis to determine whether each feature could be correctly decoded from regional activities. The early visual area showed significant above-chance classification accuracy, particularly high in perspective, hand, and size, consistent with pixel-wise dissimilarity of stimuli. In contrast, the highest decoding accuracy for action was observed in the anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS) and the ventral premotor cortex (PMv). Moreover, the decoder for action could be correctly generalized for images with high dissimilarity in the parietal and premotor region, but not in the visual area. Our study indicates that the parietal and premotor regions encode observed actions independent of retinal variations, which may subserve our capacity for invariant action recognition of others.},

title = {TrkB but not trkC receptors are necessary for postnatal maintenance of hippocampal spines},
abstract = {Dendritic spines are major sites of excitatory synaptic transmission and changes in their densities have been linked to alterations in learning and memory. The neurotrophins brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin-3 and their receptors, trkB and trkC, are thought to be involved in learning, memory and long-term potentiation (LTP). LTP is known to induce trkB and trkC gene expression as well as spinogenesis in the hippocampus. In the aging hippocampus, declines in trkB and trkC mRNA levels may underlie, at least in part, impairments in spatial memory and reductions in spine densities. To determine the significance of trkB and trkC for the maintenance of dendritic spines, we have analyzed Golgi-impregnated hippocampi of adult and aged mice heterozygous for trkB, trkC, or both along with respective wildtype littermates. Deletion of one allele of trkB, but not trkC, significantly reduces spine densities of CA1 pyramidal neurons in both adult and aged mice, as compared to age-matched controls. This indicates that trkB, but not trkC, receptors are necessary for the maintenance of hippocampal spines during postnatal life.},

title = {Two types of dopamine neuron distinctly convey positive and negative motivational signals},
abstract = {Midbrain dopamine neurons are activated by reward or sensory stimuli predicting reward1--4. These excitatory responses increase as the reward value increases5. This response property has led to a hypothesis that dopamine neurons encode value-related signals and are inhibited by aversive events. Here we show that this is true only for a subset of dopamine neurons. We recorded the activity of dopamine neurons in monkeys (Macaca mulatta) during a Pavlovian procedure with appetitive and aversive outcomes (liquid rewards and airpuffs directed at the face, respectively). We found that some dopamine neurons were excited by reward- predicting stimuli and inhibited by airpuff-predicting stimuli, as the value hypothesis predicts. However, a greater number of dopa- mine neurons were excited by both of these stimuli, inconsistent with the hypothesis. Some dopamine neurons were also excited by both rewards and airpuffs themselves, especially when they were unpredictable. Neurons excited by the airpuff-predicting stimuli were located more dorsolaterally in the substantia nigra pars com- pacta, whereas neurons inhibited by the stimuli were located more ventromedially, some in the ventral tegmental area. A similar ana- tomical difference was observed for their responses to actual air- puffs. These findings suggest that different groups of dopamine neurons convey motivational signals in distinct manners.},

title = {"Brain-reading" of perceived colors reveals a feature mixing mechanism underlying perceptual filling-in in cortical area V1},
abstract = {Visual filling-in occurs when a retinally stabilized object undergoes perceptual fading. As the term "filling-in" implies, it is commonly believed that information about the apparently vanished object is lost and replaced solely by information arising from the surrounding background. Here we report multivoxel pattern analysis fMRI data that challenge this long-held belief. When subjects view blue disks on a red background while fixating, the stimulus and background appear to turn a uniform purple upon perceptual fading, suggesting that a feature mixing mechanism may underlie color filling-in. We find that ensemble fMRI signals in retinotopic visual areas reliably predict (i) which of three colors a subject reports seeing; (ii) whether a subject is in a perceptually filled-in state or not; and (iii) furthermore, while subjects are in the perceptual state of filling-in, the BOLD signal activation pattern in the sub-areas of V1 corresponding to the location of the blue disks behaves as if subjects are in fact viewing a perceptually mixed color (purple), rather than the color of the disks (blue) or the color of the background (red). These results imply that the mechanism of filling-in in stimuli in which figure and background surfaces are equated is a process of "feature mixing", not "feature replacement". These data indicate that feature mixing may involve cortical areas as early as V1.},

title = {Prefrontal-basal ganglia pathways are involved in the learning of arbitrary visuomotor associations: a PET study},
abstract = {Primates can learn to associate sensory cues with particular movements according to arbitrary rules. We used positron emission tomography (PET) to study the neural network involved in learning such arbitrary associations by trial and error. Ten subjects were scanned at four different stages of learning a visuomotor conditional task (VC). The subjects were required to associate four different visual patterns, presented one at a time, with four different finger movements. Scan 1 was acquired during initial learning. Scans 2, 3 and 4 were performed after further interscan training periods of 1, 3 and 5 min. In order to control for non-specific time effects that could have confounded the learning-related rCBF changes, we also acquired four sensory-matched control scans, in which no movements were performed. In order to evaluate changes over time that were specific to learning the association of visual cues with movements, we acquired four scans during the learning of a motor sequence task. The statistical model tested with SPM considered both main effects of tasks and task x time interactions independently for each of the three experimental conditions. The right lingual gyrus and the left parahippocampal cortex increased their activity over scans in the VC task as compared to the sensory control. The right inferior frontal sulcus, the body of the caudate nucleus and a left cingulate motor area were specifically implicated in learning the VC task, showing task x time interactions with the motor sequence task. These findings suggest that the learning process involves a distributed network in the ventral extrastriate and prefrontal cortex, in association with the basal ganglia and the parahippocampal gyrus.},

abstract = {The premise of Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis (MVPA) of functional Magnetic Resonance Image (fMRI) data is that mental encodings or states give rise to patterns of neural activation, which in turn, give rise to patterns of blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) responses distributed across sets of voxels. Statistical learning algorithms can then be used to detect relationships between mental encodings and BOLD responses, typically through pattern classification. Amongst many other applications, this technique has been used to evidence abstract category representation in an assortment of brain areas and across a range of cognitive domains. In this commentary, we address a critical domain-general caveat to inferring abstract category representation from MVPA that has been partly overlooked in the recent literature: specifically, the distinction between representing specific exemplars within categories, and representing the abstract categories themselves. Using a simulation, we demonstrate that certain forms of MVPA training and testing do not constitute sufficient evidence of category representation, and illustrate prospective and novel retrospective resolutions for this issue.},

This occurs, for example, when stimuli processed via one sensory modality imply features characteristic of a different modality; for instance, visual stimuli that imply touch have been observed to activate the primary somatosensory cortex (SI). In the present study, we addressed the question of whether such cross-modal activations are content specific. To this end, we investigated neural activity in the primary somatosensory cortex of subjects who observed human hands engaged in the haptic exploration of different everyday objects. Using multivariate pattern analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging data, we were able to predict, based exclusively on the activity pattern in SI, which of several objects a subject saw being explored. Along with previous studies that found similar evidence for other modalities, our results suggest that primary sensory cortices represent information relevant for their modality even when this information enters the brain via a different sensory system.},

title = {Lesions of dorsolateral striatum preserve outcome expectancy but disrupt habit formation in instrumental learning},
abstract = {Habits are controlled by antecedent stimuli rather than by goal expectancy. Interval schedules of feedback have been shown to generate habits, as revealed by the insensitivity of behaviour acquired under this schedule to outcome devaluation treatments. Two experiments were conducted to assess the role of the dorsolateral striatum in habit learning. In Experiment 1, sham operated controls and rats with dorsolateral striatum lesions were trained to press a lever for sucrose under interval schedules. After training, the sucrose was devalued by inducing taste aversion to it using lithium chloride, whereas saline injections were given to the controls. Only rats given the devaluation treatment reduced their consumption of sucrose and this reduction was similar in both the sham and the lesioned groups. All rats were then returned to the instrumental chamber for an extinction test, in which the lever was extended but no sucrose was delivered. In contrast to sham operated controls, rats with dorsolateral striatum lesions refrained from pressing the lever if the outcome was devalued. To assess the specificity of the role of dorsolateral striatum in this effect a second experiment was conducted in which a group with lesions of dorsomedial striatum was added. In relation now to both the sham and the dorsomedial lesioned groups, only rats with lesions of dorsolateral striatum significantly reduced responding after outcome devaluation. In conclusion, this study provides direct evidence that the dorsolateral striatum is necessary for habit formation. Furthermore, it suggests that, when the habit system is disrupted, control over instrumental performance reverts to the system controlling the performance of goal-directed instrumental actions.},

title = {A comment on the severity of the effects of non-white noise in fMRI time-series},
abstract = {Analysis of fMRI time-series data is usually performed within the general linear model (GLM), and conclusions are based on the probability (p) of a false-positive voxel. In its simplest form, this process assumes that temporal noise in the time-series is random (white); if it is not, then an error in the estimation of p will occur. Various methods for correcting the problem have been developed, but they are not always used. Analysis packages vary in their ability to deal with this problem, and there is a lack of consistent advice to non-experts concerning whether this issue is serious or is small enough to be ignored. The variability of expert opinion partly reflects the fact that the magnitude of the error that occurs when estimating p in fMRI data is largely undocumented. In this discussion, aimed more at "neuroscience users" than methods experts, we try to clarify the position by documenting the scale of the error in a simple block-design experiment. Based on a fixed-effects group analysis of null datasets (8 participants scanned while at rest), we show that the magnitude of the problem can be very substantial. Without correction, it was necessary to set a nominal probability threshold of about p=0.000001 in order to achieve an actual probability of a false positive of 0.001. This means that if task-related activations were present in such a dataset, only if they reached the former, very low nominal p value could they be relied upon. With the use of standard correction methods, the error was largely removed. Our results suggest that some form of pre-whitening or correction for effects of non-white noise is essential in single-subject GLM analyses and fixed-effects group analyses of fMRI data. It is less important but probably prudent to apply a correction at the first level of random-effects group analyses. We also evaluate the effect of high-pass filtering. We find that the number of false positives in a fixed-effects analysis increases markedly as the filter cut-off frequency is increased. The sensitivity benefits derived from high-pass filtering may thus be partially offset by a significant increase in the number of false positives.},

abstract = {The spiny projection neurons of the neostriatum are a site at which dopamine inputs from the substantia nigra converge with excitatory inputs from the cerebral cortex. These two systems interact in certain learning and motor control mechanisms of the brain. We investigated these interactions using intracellular recording from spiny striatal neurons in urethane-anaesthetized rats. We found that acute dopamine depletion was associated with long-term depression of corticostriatal synaptic input. Electrical stimulation of the cortex which mimicked synchronous cortical input to striatal neurons also induced long-term depression of corticostriatal inputs. In intact control animals, but not in dopamine-depleted animals, this depression was prevented or reversed by concomitant stimulation of the substantia nigra. In agreement with previous in vitro studies, our in vivo findings show that long-term depression occurs in the corticostriatal pathway, and in addition show that it is regulated by dopaminergic inputs from the substantia nigra. This form of synaptic plasticity may therefore be important for understanding disturbances of the motor system seen in humans with Parkinson's disease.},

abstract = {The "Weather Prediction" task is a widely used task for investigating probabilistic category learning, in which various cues are probabilistically (but not perfectly) predictive of class membership. This means that a given combination of cues sometimes belongs to one class and sometimes to another. Prior studies showed that subjects can improve their performance with training, and that there is considerable individual variation in the strategies subjects use to approach this task. Here, we discuss a recently introduced analysis of probabilistic categorization, which attempts to identify the strategy followed by a participant. Monte Carlo simulations show that the analysis can, indeed, reliably identify such a strategy if it is used, and can identify switches from one strategy to another. Analysis of data from normal young adults shows that the fitted strategy can predict subsequent responses. Moreover, learning is shown to be highly nonlinear in probabilistic categorization. Analysis of performance of patients with dense memory impairments due to hippocampal damage shows that although these patients can change strategies, they are as likely to fall back to an inferior strategy as to move to more optimal ones.},

We found that activity in the medial orbitofrontal cortex and in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex encodes subjects' WTP for the items. Our results support the hypothesis that the medial orbitofrontal cortex encodes the value of goals in decision making.},

abstract = {We present a framework aimed to reveal directed interactions of activated brain areas using time-resolved fMRI and vector autoregressive (VAR) modeling in the context of Granger causality. After describing the underlying mathematical concepts, we present simulations helping to characterize the conditions under which VAR modeling and Granger causality can reveal directed interactions from fluctuations in BOLD-like signal time courses. We apply the proposed approach to a dynamic sensorimotor mapping paradigm. In an event-related fMRI experiment, subjects performed a visuomotor mapping task for which the mapping of two stimuli ("faces" vs "houses") to two responses ("left" or "right") alternated periodically between the two possible mappings. Besides expected activity in sensory and motor areas, a fronto-parietal network was found to be active during presentation of a cue indicating a change in the stimulus-response (S-R) mapping. The observed network includes the superior parietal lobule and premotor areas. These areas might be involved in setting up and maintaining stimulus-response associations. The Granger causality analysis revealed a directed influence exerted by the left lateral prefrontal cortex and premotor areas on the left posterior parietal cortex.},

abstract = {Functional brain imaging data may contain large individual differences in information about whole brain and regional levels of activity, and it is common to remove these differences using arithmetic transformation (normalization) prior to statistical analysis. As no single transformation is widely accepted, we examine the effects of four normalizing methods (ratioing, residuals from regressions on global cerebral blood flow, Z scores, and subject residual profiles) on 1) profile shape, 2) correlations between regions, 3) correlations between subjects, and 4) analysis of variance results. These effects are evaluated using an empirical data set consisting of regional cerebral blood flow values from 22 regions of interest in 46 depressed adults and 48 age-matched normal controls obtained by 133Xe single photon emission computed tomography. Results show that normalization method has substantial but different effects on characteristics of the data and statistical results. The rationing method appears to be an optimal choice for most analyses.},

abstract = {The brain circuitry processing rewarding and aversive stimuli is hypothesized to be at the core of motivated behavior. In this study, discrete categories of beautiful faces are shown to have differing reward values and to differentially activate reward circuitry in human subjects. In particular, young heterosexual males rate pictures of beautiful males and females as attractive, but exert effort via a keypress procedure only to view pictures of attractive females. Functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T shows that passive viewing of beautiful female faces activates reward circuitry, in particular the nucleus accumbens. An extended set of subcortical and paralimbic reward regions also appear to follow aspects of the keypress rather than the rating procedures, suggesting that reward circuitry function does not include aesthetic assessment.},

title = {Specialized neural systems underlying representations of sequential movements},
abstract = {The ease by which movements are combined into skilled actions depends on many factors, including the complexity of movement sequences. Complexity can be defined by the surface structure of a sequence, including motoric properties such as the types of effectors, and by the abstract or sequence-specific structure, which is apparent in the relations amongst movements, such as repetitions. It is not known whether different neural systems support the cognitive and the sensorimotor processes underlying different structural properties of sequential actions. We investigated this question using whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in healthy adults as they performed sequences of five key presses involving up to three fingers. The structure of sequences was defined by two factors that independently lengthen the time to plan sequences before movement: the number of different fingers (1-3; surface structure) and the number of finger transitions (0-4; sequence-specific structure). The results showed that systems involved in visual processing (extrastriate cortex) and the preparation of sensory aspects of movement (rostral inferior parietal and ventral premotor cortex (PMv)) correlated with both properties of sequence structure. The number of different fingers positively correlated with activation intensity in the cerebellum and superior parietal cortex (anterior), systems associated with sensorimotor, and kinematic representations of movement, respectively. The number of finger transitions correlated with activation in systems previously associated with sequence-specific processing, including the inferior parietal and the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), and in interconnecting superior temporal-middle frontal gyrus networks. Different patterns of activation in the left and right inferior parietal cortex were associated with different sequences, consistent with the speculation that sequences are encoded using different mnemonics, depending on the sequence-specific structure. In contrast, PMd activation correlated positively with increases in the number of transitions, consistent with the role of this area in the retrieval or preparation of abstract action plans. These findings suggest that the surface and the sequence-specific structure of sequential movements can be distinguished by distinct distributed systems that support their underlying mental operations.},

abstract = {The recent upsurge in placebo research has demonstrated the sound neurobiological substrate of a phenomenon once believed to be only patient mystification, or at best a variable to control in clinical trials, bringing about a new awareness of its potential exploitation to the patient's benefit and framing it as a positive context effect, with the power to influence the therapy outcome. Placebo effects have been described both in the experimental setting and in different clinical conditions, many of which are of neurological interest. Multiple mechanisms have been described, namely conditioning and cognitive factors like expectation, desire, and reward. A body of evidence from neurochemical, pharmacological, and neuroimaging studies points to the involvement of neural pathways specific to single conditions, such as the activation of the endogenous antinociceptive system during placebo analgesia or the release of dopamine in the striatum of parkinsonian patients experiencing placebo reduction of motor impairment. The possible clinical applications of placebo studies range from the design of clinical trials incorporating specific recommendations and minimizing the use of placebo arms to the optimization of the context surrounding the patient, in order to maximize the placebo component present in any treatment.},

abstract = {Although our understanding of the cellular properties of mammalian neurons is increasing rapidly, the computational function of their elaborate dendritic trees is still mysterious. In recent years, experiments have shown that, in pyramidal cells, individual dendritic compartments sustain local excitation spikes.. These dendrites also support Hebbian synaptic plasticity, which depends on the precise temporal relationship between pre- and postsynaptic spikes. In this review we discuss what we consider to be a problem with Hebbian (i.e., spike-timing-dependent) plasticity. We argue that most of the spikes that occur in dendrites are not back-propagating action potentials but but local spikes, and that Hebbian plasticity caused by local spikes can undermine the functional integrity of the geometrically complex dendritic tree. We propose that the inverted Hebbian plasticity of synapses involved in local spikes, and/or local dendritic homeostatic plasticity, could prevent an unbalanced distribution of synaptic weights on the dendritic tree.},

title = {A physiologically plausible model of action selection and oscillatory activity in the basal ganglia},
abstract = {The basal ganglia (BG) have long been implicated in both motor function and dysfunction. It has been proposed that the BG form a centralized action selection circuit, resolving conflict between multiple neural systems competing for access to the final common motor pathway. We present a new spiking neuron model of the BG circuitry to test this proposal, incorporating all major features and many physiologically plausible details. We include the following: effects of dopamine in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus (GP), transmission delays between neurons, and specific distributions of synaptic inputs over dendrites. All main parameters were derived from experimental studies. We find that the BG circuitry supports motor program selection and switching, which deteriorates under dopamine-depleted and dopamine-excessive conditions in a manner consistent with some pathologies associated with those dopamine states. We also validated the model against data describing oscillatory properties of BG. We find that the same model displayed detailed features of both gamma-band (30-80 Hz) and slow (approximately 1 Hz) oscillatory phenomena reported by Brown et al. (2002) and Magill et al. (2001), respectively. Only the parameters required to mimic experimental conditions (e.g., anesthetic) or manipulations (e.g., lesions) were changed. From the results, we derive the following novel predictions about the STN-GP feedback loop: (1) the loop is functionally decoupled by tonic dopamine under normal conditions and recoupled by dopamine depletion; (2) the loop does not show pacemaking activity under normal conditions in vivo (but does after combined dopamine depletion and cortical lesion); (3) the loop has a resonant frequency in the gamma-band.},

title = {Addiction as a computational process gone awry},
abstract = {Addictive drugs have been hypothesized to access the same neurophysiological mechanisms as natural learning systems. These natural learning systems can be modeled through temporal-difference reinforcement learning (TDRL), which requires a reward-error signal that has been hypothesized to be carried by dopamine. TDRL learns to predict reward by driving that reward-error signal to zero. By adding a noncompensable drug-induced dopamine increase to a TDRL model, a computational model of addiction is constructed that over-selects actions leading to drug receipt. The model provides an explanation for important aspects of the addiction literature and provides a theoretic view-point with which to address other aspects.},

title = {Discrete coding of reward probability and uncertainty by dopamine neurons},
abstract = {Uncertainty is critical in the measure of information and in assessing the accuracy of predictions. It is determined by probability P, being maximal at P = 0.5 and decreasing at higher and lower probabilities. Using distinct stimuli to indicate the probability of reward, we found that the phasic activation of dopamine neurons varied monotonically across the full range of probabilities, supporting past claims that this response codes the discrepancy between predicted and actual reward. In contrast, a previously unobserved response covaried with uncertainty and consisted of a gradual increase in activity until the potential time of reward. The coding of uncertainty suggests a possible role for dopamine signals in attention-based learning and risk-taking behavior.},

abstract = {Projections from cortical and subcortical limbic structures to the basal ganglia are predominantly directed to the ventral striatum. The present study investigated how the expectation of external events with behavioral significance is reflected in the activity of ventral striatal neurons. A total of 420 neurons were studied in macaque monkeys performing in a delayed go-no-go task. Lights of different colors instructed the animal to do an arm-reaching movement or refrain from moving, respectively, when a trigger light was illuminated a few seconds later. Task performance was reinforced by liquid reward in both situations. A total of 60 ventral striatal neurons showed sustained increases of activity before the occurrence of individual task events. In 43 of these neurons, activations specifically preceded the delivery of reward, independent of the movement or no-movement reaction. In a series of additional tests, these activations were time locked to the subsequent reward, disappeared within a few trials when reward was omitted, and were temporally unrelated to mouth movements. Changes in the appetitive value of the reward liquid modified the magnitude of activations, suggesting a possible relationship to the hedonic properties of the expected event. Activations also occurred when reward was delivered in a predictable manner outside of any behavioral task. These data suggest that neurons in the ventral striatum are activated during states of expectation of individual environmental events that are predictable to the subject through its past experience. The prevalence of activations related to the expectation of reward suggests that ventral striatal neurons have access to central representations of reward and thereby participate in the processing of information underlying the motivational control of goal-directed behavior.},

title = {Neurotrophins modulate neuron-glia interactions at a vertebrate synapse},
abstract = {Abstract Neurotrophins are important modulators of synaptic function at both developing and mature synapses in the CNS and PNS. At the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), neurotrophins, as well as perisynaptic Schwann cells (PSCs) are critical for the long-term maintenance and stability of the synapse. Considering this correlation and the acute interactions that occur at the synapse between PSCs and the nerve terminal, we wondered if neurotrophins could also be involved in neuron-glia signalling. To test if neurotrophins were able to signal to PSCs we used brief applications of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), brain-derived neurotophic factor (BDNF) or nerve growth factor (NGF; 100 ng/mL). Soleus muscles of mice were incubated with the Ca2+ indicator Fluo-4AM and Ca2+ responses in PSCs were elicited through nerve stimulation (50 Hz, 30 s). Our results indicate that acute application of both NT-3 and BDNF, but not NGF, increased PSC Ca2+ responses. Investigation of the mechanisms involved in these increases revealed distinct pathways for BDNF and NT-3. BDNF increased PSC responsiveness through potentiation of ATP responses while NT-3 modulated muscarinic acetylcholine receptor signalling. Using local applications of the neurotrophins, we found that both neurotrophins were able to elicit Ca2+ responses in PSCs where BDNF used a phospholipase C-inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (PLC-IP3) mechanism, while NT-3 required extracellular Ca2+. Our results demonstrate a neurotrophin-dependent modulation of neuron-glia signalling through differential mechanisms employed by NT-3 and BDNF. Hence, neurotrophins precisely and differentially regulate PSC functions through modulation of either purinergic or cholinergic signalling pathways.},

title = {The orbitofrontal cortex and beyond: From affect to decision-making},
abstract = {The orbitofrontal cortex represents the reward or affective value of primary reinforcers including taste, touch, texture, and face expression. It learns to associate other stimuli with these to produce representations of the expected reward value for visual, auditory, and abstract stimuli including monetary reward value. The orbitofrontal cortex thus plays a key role in emotion, by representing the goals for action. The learning process is stimulus-reinforcer association learning. Negative reward prediction error neurons are related to this affective learning. Activations in the orbitofrontal cortex correlate with the subjective emotional experience of affective stimuli, and damage to the orbitofrontal cortex impairs emotion-related learning, emotional behaviour, and subjective affective state. With an origin from beyond the orbitofrontal cortex, top-down attention to affect modulates orbitofrontal cortex representations, and attention to intensity modulates representations in earlier cortical areas of the physical properties of stimuli. Top-down word-level cognitive inputs can bias affective representations in the orbitofrontal cortex, providing a mechanism for cognition to influence emotion. Whereas the orbitofrontal cortex provides a representation of reward or affective value on a continuous scale, areas beyond the orbitofrontal cortex such as the medial prefrontal cortex area 10 are involved in binary decision-making when a choice must be made. For this decision-making, the orbitofrontal cortex provides a representation of each specific reward in a common currency.},

abstract = {The error-related negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe) are electrophysiological markers of error processing thought to originate in the medial frontal cortex. Previous studies using probabilistic reinforcement showed that individuals who learn more from negative than from positive feedback (negative learners) had larger ERNs than did positive learners. These findings support the dopamine (DA) reinforcement-learning hypothesis of the ERN and associated computational models. However, it remains unclear (1) to what extent these effects generalize to tasks outside the restricted probabilistic reinforcement-learning domain and (2) whether there is a dopaminergic source of these effects. To address these issues, we tested subjects' reinforcement-learning biases behaviorally and recorded EEG during an unrelated recognition memory experiment. Initial recognition responses were speeded, but the subjects were subsequently allowed to self-correct their responses. We found that negative learners, as assessed via probabilistic learning, had larger ERNs in the recognition memory task, suggestive of a common underlying enhanced error-processing mechanism. Negative learners also had enhanced Pes when self-correcting errors than did positive learners. Moreover, the ERN and Pe components contributed independently to negative learning. We also tested for a dopaminergic genetic basis of these ERP components. We analyzed the COMT val/met polymorphism, which has been linked to frontal DA levels. The COMT genotype affected Pe (but not ERN) magnitude; met/met homozygotes showed enhanced Pes to self-corrected errors, as compared with val carriers. These results are consistent with a role for the Pe and frontal monoamines in error awareness.},

Previous numerical work has reported that Hebbian learning drives the system from chaos to a steady state through a sequence of bifurcations. Here, we interpret these results mathematically and show that these effects, involving a complex coupling between neuronal dynamics and synaptic graph structure, can be analyzed using Jacobian matrices, which introduce both a structural and a dynamical point of view on neural network evolution. Furthermore, we show that sensitivity to a learned pattern is maximal when the largest Lyapunov exponent is close to 0. We discuss how neural networks may take advantage of this regime of high functional interest.},

title = {Nonlinear aspects of the BOLD response in functional MRI},
abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast has progressed rapidly and is commonly used to study function in many regions of the human brain. This paper introduces a method for characterizing the linear and nonlinear properties of the hemodynamic response. Such characterization is essential for accurate prediction of time-course behavior. Linearity of the BOLD response was examined in the primary visual cortex for manipulations of the stimulus amplitude and duration. Stimuli of 1, 2, 4, and 8 s duration (80% contrast) and 10, 20, 40, and 80% contrast (4 s duration) were used to test the hemodynamic response. Superposition of the obtained responses was performed to determine if the BOLD response is nonlinear. The nonlinear characteristics of the BOLD response were assessed using a Laplacian linear system model cascaded with a broadening function. Discrepancies between the model and the observed response provide an indirect measure of the nonlinearity of the response. The Laplacian linear system remained constant within subjects so the broadening function can be used to absorb nonlinearities in the response. The results show that visual stimulation under 4 s in duration and less than 40% contrast yield strong nonlinear responses.},

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies suggest that humans have a ventral temporal face area, but such evidence is lacking in macaques. Instead, face-responsive neurons in macaques seem to be scattered throughout temporal cortex, with some relative concentration in the superior temporal sulcus (STS). Here, using fMRI in alert fixating macaque monkeys and humans, we found that macaques do have discrete face-selective patches, similar in relative size and number to face patches in humans. The face patches were embedded within a large swath of object-selective cortex extending from V4 to rostral TE. This large region responded better to pictures of intact objects compared to scrambled objects, with different object categories eliciting different patterns of activity, as in the human. Overall, our results suggest that humans and macaques share a similar brain architecture for visual object processing.},

We then demonstrate that 74% of this brain-behavior relationship is attributable to ongoing fluctuations in intrinsic activity similar to those observed during resting fixation.

As subthreshold resonances are known to infuence the rhythmic activity at the network level, it is vital to understand how they affect spike generation on the single-cell level. We therefore investigated resonant as well as nonresonant neurons of rat entorhinal cortex. A minimal resonate-and-fire type model based on measured physiological parameters captures fundamental properties of neuronal firing statistics surprisingly well and helps to shed light on the mechanisms that shape spike patterns: (i) subthreshold resonance together with a spike-induced reset of subthreshold oscillations leads to spike clustering, (ii) spike-induced dynamics infuence the fne structure of interspike interval (ISI) distributions and are responsible for ISI correlations appearing at higher fring rates (3 Hz). Both mechanisms are likely to account for the specifc discharge characteristics of various cell types.},

title = {Cortical mechanisms of action selection: the affordance competition hypothesis},
abstract = {At every moment, the natural world presents animals with two fundamental pragmatic problems: selection between actions that are currently possible and specification of the parameters or metrics of those actions. It is commonly suggested that the brain addresses these by first constructing representations of the world on which to build knowledge and make a decision, and then by computing and executing an action plan. However, neurophysiological data argue against this serial viewpoint. In contrast, it is proposed here that the brain processes sensory information to specify, in parallel, several potential actions that are currently available. These potential actions compete against each other for further processing, while information is collected to bias this competition until a single response is selected. The hypothesis suggests that the dorsal visual system specifies actions which compete against each other within the fronto-parietal cortex, while a variety of biasing influences are provided by prefrontal regions and the basal ganglia. A computational model is described, which illustrates how this competition may take place in the cerebral cortex. Simulations of the model capture qualitative features of neurophysiological data and reproduce various behavioural phenomena.},

title = {Activation of D1 dopamine receptors increases surface expression of AMPA receptors and facilitates their synaptic incorporation in cultured hippocampal neurons},
abstract = {Considerable evidence indicates that neuroadaptations leading to addiction involve the same cellular processes that enable learning and memory, such as long-term potentiation (LTP), and that psychostimulants influence LTP through dopamine (DA)-dependent mechanisms. In hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, LTP involves insertion of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) receptors into excitatory synapses. We used dissociated cultures to test the hypothesis that D1 family DA receptors influence synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons by modulating AMPA receptor trafficking. Brief exposure (5 min) to a D1 agonist increased surface expression of glutamate receptor (GluR)1-containing AMPA receptors by increasing their rate of externalization at extrasynaptic sites. This required the secretory pathway but not protein synthesis, and was mediated mainly by protein kinase A (PKA) with a smaller contribution from Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). Prior D1 receptor stimulation facilitated synaptic insertion of GluR1 in response to subsequent stimulation of synaptic NMDA receptors with glycine. Our results support a model for synaptic GluR1 incorporation in which PKA is required for initial insertion into the extrasynaptic membrane whereas CaMKII mediates translocation into the synapse. By increasing the size of the extrasynaptic GluR1 pool, D1 receptors may promote LTP. Psychostimulants may usurp this mechanism, leading to inappropriate plasticity that contributes to addiction-related behaviors.},

abstract = {The frontostriatal system has been implicated in linking sensory information and action through arbitrary rules. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of the striatum, a key, integrative structure in such behavior. We recorded single neuronal activity from the anterior striatum of two macaque monkeys as they learned to associate new visual cues with motor responses. Monkeys held a joystick which they could move in one of four constrained directions. During the recording sessions, they were presented with a set of well-learned associations (familiar condition), and with sets of new cues which they were required to map, by trial and error, with joystick movements (novel condition). A sample of 50 striatum neurons were studied during execution of familiar and novel conditions. Activity of most of them was strongly modulated during learning. These modulations were either transient or long lasting changes of neuronal firing rate. The findings suggest that the striatum is involved in early stages of conditional visuomotor learning, and are interpreted in relation with previous data on frontal cortex.},

title = {Why don't we move faster? Parkinson's disease, movement vigor, and implicit motivation},
abstract = {People generally select a similar speed for a given motor task, such as reaching for a cup. One well established determinant of movement time is the speed-accuracy trade-off: movement time increases with the accuracy requirement. A second possible determinant is the energetic cost of making a movement. Parkinson's disease (PD), a condition characterized by generalized movement slowing (bradykinesia), provides the opportunity to directly explore this second possibility. We compared reaching movements of patients with PD with those of control subjects in a speed-accuracy trade-off task comprising conditions of increasing difficulty. Subjects completed as many trials as necessary to make 20 movements within a required speed range (trials to criterion, N(c)). Difficulty was reflected in endpoint accuracy and N(c). Patients were as accurate as control subjects in all conditions (i.e., PD did not affect the speed-accuracy trade-off). However, N(c) was consistently higher in patients, indicating reluctance to move fast although accuracy was not compromised. Specifically, the dependence of N(c) on movement energy cost (slope S(N)) was steeper in patients than in control subjects. This difference in S(N) suggests that bradykinesia represents an implicit decision not to move fast because of a shift in the cost/benefit ratio of the energy expenditure needed to move at normal speed. S(N) was less steep, but statistically significant, in control subjects, which demonstrates a role for energetic cost in the normal control of movement speed. We propose that, analogous to the established role of dopamine in explicit reward-seeking behavior, the dopaminergic projection to the striatum provides a signal for implicit "motor motivation."},

abstract = {The central goal of modern science that evolved during the Enlightenment was the empirical reduction of uncertainty by experimental inquiry. Although there have been challenges to this view in the physical sciences, where profoundly indeterminate events have been identified at the quantum level, the presumption that physical phenomena are fundamentally determinate seems to have defined modern behavioral science. Programs like those of the classical behaviorists, for example, were explicitly anchored to a fully deterministic worldview, and this anchoring clearly influenced the experiments that those scientists chose to perform. Recent advances in the psychological, social, and neural sciences, however, have caused a number of scholars to begin to question the assumption that all of behavior can be regarded as fundamentally deterministic in character. Although it is not yet clear whether the generative mechanisms for human and animal behavior will require a philosophically indeterminate approach, it is clear that behavioral scientists of all kinds are beginning to engage the issues of indeterminacy that plagued physics at the beginning of the twentieth century.},

title = {Dopamine gates action potential backpropagation in midbrain dopaminergic neurons},
abstract = {Dopamine is released from both axonal and somatodendritic sites of midbrain dopaminergic neurons in an action potential-dependent manner. In contrast to the majority of central neurons, the axon of dopaminergic neurons typically originates from a dendritic site, suggesting a specialized computational function. Here, we examine the initiation and spread of action potentials in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars reticulata and reveal that the displacement of the axon to a dendritic site allows highly compartmentalized electrical signaling. In response to a train of synaptic input, action potentials initiated at axon-bearing dendritic sites formed a variable trigger for invasion to the soma and contralateral dendritic tree, with action potentials often confined to the axon-bearing dendrite. The application of dopamine increased this form of electrical compartmentalization, an effect mediated by a tonic membrane potential hyperpolarization leading to an increased availability of a class of voltage-dependent potassium channel. These data suggest that the release of dopamine from axonal and somatodendritic sites are dissociable, and that dopamine levels within the midbrain are dynamically controlled by the somatodendritic spread of action potentials.},

title = {NMDA Receptors in Glia},
abstract = {The amino acid L-Glutamate acts as the most ubiquitous mediator of excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. Glutamatergic transmission is central for diverse brain functions, being particularly important for learning, memory, and cognition. In brain pathology, excessive release of glutamate triggers excitotoxic neural cell death through necrotic or apoptotic pathways. Glutamate effects are mediated by several classes of glutamate receptors, expressed in virtually all cells of neural origin. Specifically important for both physiological information processing and cell damage are glutamate receptors of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) type, which, for a long time, were considered to be expressed exclusively in neurons. Recent studies have found functional NMDA receptors in brain macroglia, in astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Glial and neuronal NMDA receptors are functionally and structurally different; the glial receptors are weakly (if at all) sensitive to the extracellular magnesium block, which may indicate a predominant expression of the NR3 receptor subunit. In the cortex, astroglial NMDA receptors are activated upon physiological synaptic transmission. The physiological relevance of NMDA receptors in the white matter remains unknown; their activation upon ischemia triggers Ca2+-dependent damage of oligodendrocytes and myelin. The discovery of glial NMDA receptors further indicates the complex nature of intercellular signaling mechanisms in the brain, which involve all types of neural cells, connected through diverse types of chemical and electrical synapses.},

title = {Position and behavioral modulation of synchronization of hippocampal and accumbens neuronal discharges in freely moving rats},
abstract = {To understand how hippocampal signals are processed by downstream neurons, we analyzed the relative timing between neuronal discharges in simultaneous recordings in the hippocampus and nucleus accumbens of rats performing in a plus maze. In all, 154 pairs of cells (composed of 65 hippocampal and 56 accumbens neurons) were examined during the 1 s period prior to reward delivery. Cross-correlation analyses over a +/- 300-ms window with 10-ms bins revealed that 108 pairs had at least one significant histogram bin (P < 0.01). The most frequently occurring peaks of hippocampal firing prior to accumbens discharges appeared at latencies from -30-0 ms, corresponding to published values of the latency of the hippocampal pathway to the nucleus accumbens. Other peaks appeared most often at latencies multiples of about 110 ms prior to and after this, corresponding to theta rhythmicity. Since firing synchronization can result from several types of connectivity patterns (such as common inputs), a group of 18 hippocampus-accumbens pairs was selected as those most likely to have monosynaptic connections. The criterion was the presence of at least one highly significant peak (P < 0.001) at latencies corresponding to field potentials evoked in the accumbens by hippocampal stimulation. A significant peak occurred on all four maze arms for only one of these cell pairs, indicating positional modulation for the others. In addition, behavior dependence of the synchrony between these nucleus accumbens and hippocampus neurons was examined by studying data in relation to three different synchronization points: reward box arrival, box departure, and arrival at the center of the maze. This indicates that the functional connectivity between hippocampal and accumbens neurons was stronger when the rat was near reward areas. Ten of the hippocampal neurons in these 18 cell pairs showed 9-Hz (theta) rhythmic activity in autocorrelation analyses. Of these 10 cells, cross-correlograms from eight hippocampal-accumbens pairs also showed theta rhythmicity. Overall, these results indicate that the synchrony between hippocampus and nucleus accumbens neurons is modulated by spatial position and behavior, and theta rhythm may play an important role for this synchronization.},

title = {Distinct Hippocampal and Basal Ganglia Contributions to Probabilistic Learning and Reversal},
abstract = {Abstract The hippocampus and the basal ganglia are thought to play fundamental and distinct roles in learning and memory, supporting two dissociable memory systems. Interestingly, however, the hippocampus and the basal ganglia have each, separately, been implicated as necessary for reversal learning-the ability to adaptively change a response when previously learned stimulus-outcome contingencies are reversed. Here, we compared the contribution of the hippocampus and the basal ganglia to distinct aspects of learning and reversal. Amnesic subjects with selective hippocampal damage, Parkinson's subjects with disrupted basal ganglia function, and healthy controls were tested on a novel probabilistic learning and reversal paradigm. In this task, reversal can be achieved in two ways: Subjects can reverse a previously learned response, or, they can select a new cue during the reversal phase, effectively "opting out" of the reversal. We found that both patient groups were intact at initial learning, but differed in their ability to reverse. Amnesic subjects failed to reverse, and continued to use the same cue and response learned before the reversal. Parkinson's subjects, by contrast, opted out of the reversal by learning a new cue-outcome association. These results suggest that both the hippocampus and the basal ganglia support reversal learning, but in different ways. The basal ganglia are necessary for learning a new response when a previously learned response is no longer rewarding. The failure of the amnesic subjects to reverse their response or to learn a new cue is consistent with a more general role for the hippocampus in configural learning, and suggests it may also support the ability to respond to changes in cue-outcome contingencies.},

title = {TrkB but not trkC receptors are necessary for postnatal maintenance of hippocampal spines},
abstract = {Dendritic spines are major sites of excitatory synaptic transmission and changes in their densities have been linked to alterations in learning and memory. The neurotrophins brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin-3 and their receptors, trkB and trkC, are thought to be involved in learning, memory and long-term potentiation (LTP). LTP is known to induce trkB and trkC gene expression as well as spinogenesis in the hippocampus. In the aging hippocampus, declines in trkB and trkC mRNA levels may underlie, at least in part, impairments in spatial memory and reductions in spine densities. To determine the significance of trkB and trkC for the maintenance of dendritic spines, we have analyzed Golgi-impregnated hippocampi of adult and aged mice heterozygous for trkB, trkC, or both along with respective wildtype littermates. Deletion of one allele of trkB, but not trkC, significantly reduces spine densities of CA1 pyramidal neurons in both adult and aged mice, as compared to age-matched controls. This indicates that trkB, but not trkC, receptors are necessary for the maintenance of hippocampal spines during postnatal life.},

abstract = {Dopamine shapes a wide variety of psychomotor functions. This is mainly accomplished by modulating cortical and thalamic glutamatergic signals impinging upon principal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the striatum. Several lines of evidence suggest that dopamine D1 receptor signaling enhances dendritic excitability and glutamatergic signaling in striatonigral MSNs, whereas D2 receptor signaling exerts the opposite effect in striatopallidal MSNs. The functional antagonism between these two major striatal dopamine receptors extends to the regulation of synaptic plasticity. Recent studies, using transgenic mice in which cells express D1 and D2 receptors, have uncovered unappreciated differences between MSNs that shape glutamatergic signaling and the influence of DA on synaptic plasticity. These studies have also shown that long-term alterations in dopamine signaling produce profound and cell-type-specific reshaping of corticostriatal connectivity and function.},

title = {Defining the neural mechanisms of probabilistic reversal learning using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging},
abstract = {Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure blood oxygenation level-dependent responses in 13 young healthy human volunteers during performance of a probabilistic reversal-learning task. The task allowed the separate investigation of the relearning of stimulus-reward associations and the reception of negative feedback. Significant signal change in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex was demonstrated on trials when subjects stopped responding to the previously relevant stimulus and shifted responding to the newly relevant stimulus. Significant signal change in the region of the ventral striatum was also observed on such reversal errors, from a region of interest analysis. The ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum were not significantly activated by the other, preceding reversal errors, or when subjects received negative feedback for correct responses. Moreover, the response on the final reversal error, before shifting, was not modulated by the number of preceding reversal errors, indicating that error-related activity does not simply accumulate in this network. The signal change in this ventral frontostriatal circuit is therefore associated with reversal learning and is uncontaminated by negative feedback. Overall, these data concur with findings in rodents and nonhuman primates of reversal-learning deficits after damage to ventral frontostriatal circuitry, and also support recent clinical findings using this task.},

abstract = {Many monkeys adopt abstract response strategies as they learn to map visual symbols to responses by trial and error. According to the repeat-stay strategy, if a symbol repeats from a previous, successful trial, the monkeys should stay with their most recent response choice. According to the change-shift strategy, if the symbol changes, the monkeys should shift to a different choice. We recorded the activity of prefrontal cortex neurons while monkeys chose responses according to these two strategies. Many neurons had activity selective for the strategy used. In a subsequent block of trials, the monkeys learned fixed stimulus-response mappings with the same stimuli. Some neurons had activity selective for choosing responses based on fixed mappings, others for choosing based on abstract strategies. These findings indicate that the prefrontal cortex contributes to the implementation of the abstract response strategies that monkeys use during trial-and-error learning.},

title = {LTP and adaptation to inactivity: Overlapping mechanisms and implications for metaplasticity},
abstract = {LTP and other rapidly induced forms of synaptic modification tune individual synaptic weights, whereas slower forms of plasticity such as adaptation to inactivity are thought to keep neurons within their firing limits and preserve their capability for information processing. Here we describe progress in understanding the relationship between LTP and adaptation to inactivity. A prevailing view is that adaptation to inactivity is purely postsynaptic, scales synaptic strength uniformly across all synapses, and thus preserves relative synaptic weights without interfering with signatures of prior LTP or the relative capacity for future LTP. However, recent evidence in hippocampal neurons indicates that, like LTP, adaptation to AMPA receptor blockade can draw upon a repertoire of synaptic expression mechanisms including enhancement of presynaptic vesicular turnover and increased quantal amplitude mediated by recruitment of homomeric GluR1 AMPA receptors. These pre- and postsynaptic changes appeared coordinated and preferentially expressed at subset of synapses, thereby increasing the variability of miniature EPSCs. In contrast to the NMDA receptor-, Ca2+ entry-dependent induction of LTP, adaptation to inactivity may be mediated by attenuation of voltage-sensitive L-type Ca2+ channel function. The associated intracellular signaling involves elevation of {\$}[{\$}beta{\$}]{\$}CaMKII, which in turn downregulates {\$}[{\$}alpha{\$}]{\$}CaMKII, a key player in LTP. Thus, adaptation to inactivity and LTP are not strictly independent with regard to mechanisms of signaling and expression. Indeed, we and others have found that responses to LTP-inducing stimuli can be sharply altered by prior inactivity, suggesting that the slow adaptation changes the rules of plasticity--an interesting example of \tt"metaplasticity\tt".},

title = {Pattern Classification of Working Memory Networks Reveals Differential Effects of Methylphenidate, Atomoxetine, and Placebo in Healthy Volunteers},
abstract = {Stimulant and non-stimulant drugs can reduce symptoms of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The stimulant drug methylphenidate (MPH) and the non-stimulant drug atomoxetine (ATX) are both widely used for ADHD treatment, but their differential effects on human brain function remain unclear. We combined event-related fMRI with multivariate pattern recognition to characterize the effects of MPH and ATX in healthy volunteers performing a rewarded working memory (WM) task. The effects of MPH and ATX on WM were strongly dependent on their behavioral context. During non-rewarded trials, only MPH could be discriminated from placebo (PLC), with MPH producing a similar activation pattern to reward. During rewarded trials both drugs produced the opposite effect to reward, that is, attenuating WM networks and enhancing task-related deactivations (TRDs) in regions consistent with the default mode network (DMN). The drugs could be directly discriminated during the delay component of rewarded trials: MPH produced greater activity in WM networks and ATX produced greater activity in the DMN. Our data provide evidence that: (1) MPH and ATX have prominent effects during rewarded WM in task-activated and -deactivated networks; (2) during the delay component of rewarded trials, MPH and ATX have opposing effects on activated and deactivated networks: MPH enhances TRDs more than ATX, whereas ATX attenuates WM networks more than MPH; and (3) MPH mimics reward during encoding. Thus, interactions between drug effects and motivational state are crucial in defining the effects of MPH and ATX.Neuropsychopharmacology advance online publication, 23 February 2011; doi:10.1038/npp.2011.9.},

title = {Membrane potential has no direct role in evoking neurotransmitter release.},
abstract = {Neurons communicate by secreting a transmitter that excites or inhibits other neurons at synapses. The role of presynaptic membrane potential in triggering transmitter release is still controversial. In one view, presynaptic action potentials trigger the release by the entry of calcium ions into presynaptic terminals through voltage-dependent calcium channels. Calcium acts at high local concentrations at release sites near channel mouths to cause neurosecretion. An opposing view is that, in addition to elevating presynaptic calcium, presynaptic potential stimulates transmitter release by a distinct direct action. The relative importance of depolarization and calcium entry in neurosecretion cannot be determined because the two events are tightly linked. To delineate the roles of presynaptic potential and calcium entry in transmitter release, we have used nitr-5, a photolabile calcium chelator, and a voltage-clamp technique to control intracellular calcium and membrane potential independently at a synapse formed between cell bodies of cultured neurons of the fresh water snail Helisoma trivolvis. We found transmitter release occurred when presynaptic calcium levels were elevated to concentrations of a few micromolar, and that presynaptic voltage had no direct effect on neurosecretion.},

We measured the distributed fMRI activation patterns for different color stimuli (Experiment 1: cardinal colors (to which the LGN is known to be tuned), Experiment 2: perceptual hues) in V1. Our two main findings were that (i) cone-opponent cardinal color modulations produce highly reproducible patterns of activity in V1, but these were not unique to each color. This suggests that V1 neurons with tuning characteristics similar to those found in LGN are not spatially clustered. (ii) Unique activation patterns for perceptual hues in V1 support current evidence for a spatially clustered hue map. We believe that our work is the first to show evidence of spatial clustering of neurons with similar color preferences in human V1.},

title = {Beyond the reward hypothesis: alternative functions of nucleus accumbens dopamine},
abstract = {According to the dopamine (DA) hypothesis of reward, DA systems in the brain, particularly in the nucleus accumbens, are thought to directly mediate the rewarding or primary motivational characteristics of natural stimuli such as food, water and sex, as well as various drugs of abuse. However, there are numerous problems associated with this hypothesis. Interference with accumbens DA transmission does not substantially blunt primary motivation for natural rewards such as food, but it does disrupt the propensity of animals to engage in effortful responding to obtain food. Electrophysiological and voltammetric studies indicate that novel stimuli, conditioned stimuli that predict reward, and instrumental behaviors that deliver natural rewards all act to stimulate DA activity. Accumbens DA acts as a modulator of several functions related to motivated behavior, and can influence normal and pathological cognitive function, activational aspects of motivation, anergia or psychomotor slowing in depression, the impact of conditioned stimuli, plasticity and a variety of sensorimotor functions.},

title = {When giving is good: ventromedial prefrontal cortex activation for others' intentions},
abstract = {In social decision-making, people care both about others' outcomes and their intentions to help or harm. How the brain integrates representations of others' intentions with their outcomes, however, is unknown. In this study, participants inferred others' decisions in an economic game during functional magnetic resonance imaging. When the game was described in terms of donations, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) activation increased for inferring generous play and decreased for inferring selfish play. When the game was described in terms of individual savings, however, VMPFC activation did not distinguish between strategies. Distinct medial prefrontal regions also encoded consistency with situational norms. A separate network, including right temporoparietal junction and parahippocampal gyrus, was more activated for inferential errors in the donation than in the savings condition. These results demonstrate that neural responses to others' generosity or selfishness depend not only on their actions but also on their perceived intentions.},

abstract = {Most electrophysiology studies analyze the activity of each neuron separately. While such studies have given much insight into properties of the visual system, they have also potentially overlooked important aspects of information coded in changing patterns of activity that are distributed over larger populations of neurons. In this work, we apply a population decoding method, to better estimate what information is available in neuronal ensembles, and how this information is coded in dynamic patterns of neural activity in data recorded from inferior temporal cortex (ITC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) as macaque monkeys engaged in a delayed match-to-category task (Freedman et al. 2003). Analyses of activity patterns in ITC and PFC revealed that both areas contain 'abstract' category information (i.e., category information that is not directly correlated with properties of the stimuli); however, in general, PFC has more task-relevant information, and ITC has more detailed visual information. Analyses examining how information coded in these areas show that almost all category information is available in a small fraction of the neurons in the population. Most remarkably, our results also show that category information is coded by a non-stationary pattern of activity that changes over the course of a trial, with individual neurons containing information on much shorter time scales than the population as a whole.},

title = {Representation of future and previous spatial goals by separate neural populations in prefrontal cortex},
abstract = {The primate prefrontal cortex plays a central role in choosing goals, along with a wide variety of additional functions, including short-term memory. In the present study, we examined neuronal activity in the prefrontal cortex as monkeys used abstract response strategies to select one of three spatial goals, a selection that depended on their memory of the most recent previous goal. During each trial, the monkeys selected a future goal on the basis of events from the previous trial, including both the symbolic visual cue that had appeared on that trial and the previous goal that the monkeys had selected. When a symbolic visual cue repeated from the previous trial, the monkeys stayed with their previous goal as the next (future) goal; when the cue changed, the monkeys shifted from their previous goal to one of the two remaining locations as their future goal. We found that prefrontal neurons had activity that reflected either previous goals or future goals, but only rarely did individual cells reflect both. This finding suggests that essentially separate neural networks encode these two aspects of spatial information processing. A failure to distinguish previous and future goals could lead to two kinds of maladaptive behavior. First, wrongly representing an accomplished goal as still pending could cause perseveration or compulsive checking, two disorders commonly attributed to dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex. Second, mistaking a pending goal as already accomplished could cause the failures of omission that occur commonly in dementia.},

abstract = {A DNA microarray can track the expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously. Previous research has demonstrated that this technology can be useful in the classification of cancers. Cancer microarray data normally contains a small number of samples which have a large number of gene expression levels as features. To select relevant genes involved in different types of cancer remains a challenge. In order to extract useful gene information from cancer microarray data and reduce dimensionality, feature selection algorithms were systematically investigated in this study. Using a correlation-based feature selector combined with machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, na{\"\i}ve Bayes and support vector machines, we show that classification performance at least as good as published results can be obtained on acute leukemia and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma microarray data sets. We also demonstrate that a combined use of different classification and feature selection approaches makes it possible to select relevant genes with high confidence. This is also the first paper which discusses both computational and biological evidence for the involvement of zyxin in leukaemogenesis.},

abstract = {Synaptic changes impair previously acquired memory traces. The smaller this impairment the larger is the longevity of memories. Two strategies have been suggested to keep memories from being overwritten too rapidly while preserving receptiveness to new contents: either introducing synaptic meta levels that store the history of synaptic state changes or reducing the number of synchronously active neurons, which decreases interference. We find that synaptic metaplasticity indeed can prolong memory lifetimes but only under the restriction that the neuronal population code is not too sparse. For sparse codes, metaplasticity may actually hinder memory longevity. This is important because in memory-related brain regions as the hippocampus population codes are sparse. Comparing 2 different synaptic cascade models with binary weights, we find that a serial topology of synaptic state transitions gives rise to larger memory capacities than a model with cross transitions. For the serial model, memory capacity is virtually independent of network size and connectivity.},

title = {The ventral basal ganglia, a selection mechanism at the crossroads of space, strategy, and reward},
abstract = {The basal ganglia are often conceptualised as three parallel domains that include all the constituent nuclei. The 'ventral domain' appears to be critical for learning flexible behaviours for exploration and foraging, as it is the recipient of converging inputs from amygdala, hippocampal formation and prefrontal cortex, putatively centres for stimulus evaluation, spatial navigation, and planning/contingency, respectively. However, compared to work on the dorsal domains, the rich potential for quantitative theories and models of the ventral domain remains largely untapped, and the purpose of this review is to provide the stimulus for this work. We systematically review the ventral domain's structures and internal organisation, and propose a functional architecture as the basis for computational models. Using a full schematic of the structure of inputs to the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens core and shell), we argue for the existence of many identifiable processing channels on the basis of unique combinations of afferent inputs. We then identify the potential information represented in these channels by reconciling a broad range of studies from the hippocampal, amygdala and prefrontal cortex literatures with known properties of the ventral striatum from lesion, pharmacological, and electrophysiological studies. Dopamine's key role in learning is reviewed within the three current major computational frameworks; we also show that the shell-based basal ganglia sub-circuits are well placed to generate the phasic burst and dip responses of dopaminergic neurons. We detail dopamine's modulation of ventral basal ganglia's inputs by its actions on pre-synaptic terminals and post-synaptic membranes in the striatum, arguing that the complexity of these effects hint at computational roles for dopamine beyond current ideas. The ventral basal ganglia are revealed as a constellation of multiple functional systems for the learning and selection of flexible behaviours and of behavioural strategies, sharing the common operations of selection-by-disinhibition and of dopaminergic modulation.},

title = {Long-term reward prediction in TD models of the dopamine system},
abstract = {This article addresses the relationship between long-term reward predictions and slow-timescale neural activity in temporal difference (TD) models of the dopamine system. Such models attempt to explain how the activity of dopamine (DA) neurons relates to errors in the prediction of future rewards. Previous models have been mostly restricted to short-term predictions of rewards expected during a single, somewhat artificially defined trial. Also, the models focused exclusively on the phasic pause-and-burst activity of primate DA neurons; the neurons' slower, tonic background activity was assumed to be constant. This has led to difficulty in explaining the results of neurochemical experiments that measure indications of DA release on a slow timescale, results that seem at first glance inconsistent with a reward prediction model. In this article, we investigate a TD model of DA activity modified so as to enable it to make longer-term predictions about rewards expected far in the future. We show that these predictions manifest themselves as slow changes in the baseline error signal, which we associate with tonic DA activity. Using this model, we make new predictions about the behavior of the DA system in a number of experimental situations. Some of these predictions suggest new computational explanations for previously puzzling data, such as indications from microdialysis studies of elevated DA activity triggered by aversive events.},

abstract = {Recognition of actions and complex movements is fundamental for social interactions and action understanding. While the relationship between motor expertise and visual recognition of body movements has received a vast amount of interest, the role of visual learning remains largely unexplored. Combining psychophysics and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments, we investigated neural correlates of visual learning of complex movements. Subjects were trained to visually discriminate between very similar complex movement stimuli generated by motion morphing that were either compatible (experiments 1 and 2) or incompatible (experiment 3) with human movement execution. Employing an fMRI adaptation paradigm as index of discriminability, we scanned human subjects before and after discrimination training. The results of experiment 1 revealed three different effects as a consequence of training: (1) Emerging fMRI-selective adaptation in general motion-related areas (hMT/V5+, KO/V3b) for the differences between human-like movements. (2) Enhanced of fMRI-selective adaptation already present before training in biological motion-related areas (pSTS, FBA). (3) Changes covarying with task difficulty in frontal areas. Moreover, the observed activity changes were specific to the trained movement patterns (experiment 2). The results of experiment 3, testing artificial movement stimuli, were strikingly similar to the results obtained for human movements. General and biological motion-related areas showed movement-specific changes in fMRI-selective adaptation for the differences between the stimuli after training. These results support the existence of a powerful visual machinery for the learning of complex motion patterns that is independent of motor execution. We thus propose a key role of visual learning in action recognition.},

abstract = {The striatum represents the main input into the basal ganglia. Neurons projecting from the striatum receive a large convergence of afferents from all areas of the cortex and transmit neural information to the basal ganglia output structures. Corticostriatal transmission is essential in the regulation of voluntary movement, in addition to behavioural control, cognitive function and reward mechanisms. Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), the two main forms of synaptic plasticity, are both represented at corticostriatal synapses and strongly depend on the activation of dopamine receptors. Here, we discuss possible feedforward and feedback mechanisms by which striatal interneurons, in association with striatal spiny neurons and endogenous dopamine, influence the formation and maintenance of both LTP and LTD. We also propose a model in which the spontaneous membrane oscillations of neurons projecting from the striatum (named 'up' and 'down' states), in addition to the pattern of release of endogenous dopamine, bias the synapse towards preferential induction of LTP or LTD. Finally, we discuss how endogenous dopamine crucially influences changes in synaptic plasticity induced by pathological stimuli, such as energy deprivation.},

Experimental support for this idea has been largely limited to the developmental and reorganizational formation of neural circuits in the sensory cortices. We now propose that self-organization may also play an important role in short-term synaptic changes in reward-driven voluntary behaviors. It has recently been shown that many neurons in the basal ganglia change their sensory responses flexibly in relation to rewards. Our computational model proposes that the rapid changes in striatal projection neurons depend on the subtle balance between the Hebb-type mechanisms of excitation and inhibition, which are modulated by reinforcement signals. Simulations based on the model are shown to produce various types of neural activity similar to those found in experiments.},

title = {Decoding individual episodic memory traces in the human hippocampus},
abstract = {In recent years, multivariate pattern analyses have been performed on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, permitting prediction of mental states from local patterns of blood oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal across voxels. We previously demonstrated that it is possible to predict the position of individuals in a virtual-reality environment from the pattern of activity across voxels in the hippocampus. Although this shows that spatial memories can be decoded, substantially more challenging, and arguably only possible to investigate in humans, is whether it is feasible to predict which complex everyday experience, or episodic memory, a person is recalling. Here we document for the first time that traces of individual rich episodic memories are detectable and distinguishable solely from the pattern of fMRI BOLD signals across voxels in the human hippocampus. In so doing, we uncovered a possible functional topography in the hippocampus, with preferential episodic processing by some hippocampal regions over others. Moreover, our results imply that the neuronal traces of episodic memories are stable (and thus predictable) even over many re-activations. Finally, our data provide further evidence for functional differentiation within the medial temporal lobe, in that we show the hippocampus contains significantly more episodic information than adjacent structures.},

OVX was associated with a significant decline in performance of the memory tasks as compared to intact rats beginning at 1 week post OVX for OR and 4 weeks post OVX for OP. Golgi impregnation at 7 weeks post OVX showed significantly lower spine densities (17-53%) in the pyramidal neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex and the CA1, but not the CA3, region of the hippocampus in OVX compared to intact rats. These results suggest that cognitive impairments observed in OVX rats may be associated with morphological changes in brain areas mediating memory.},

abstract = {The capacity to accurately evaluate the causal effectiveness of our actions is key to successfully adapting to changing environments. Here we scanned subjects using functional magnetic resonance imaging while they pressed a button to earn money as the response-reward relationship changed over time. Subjects' judgments about the causal efficacy of their actions reflected the objective contingency between the rate of button pressing and the amount of money they earned. Neural responses in medial orbitofrontal cortex and dorsomedial striatum were modulated as a function of contingency, by increasing in activity during sessions when actions were highly causal compared with when they were not. Moreover, medial prefrontal cortex tracked local changes in action-outcome correlations, implicating this region in the on-line computation of contingency. These results reveal the involvement of distinct brain regions in the computational processes that establish the causal efficacy of actions, providing insight into the neural mechanisms underlying the adaptive control of behavior.},

abstract = {Despite the importance and pervasiveness of marketing, almost nothing is known about the neural mechanisms through which it affects decisions made by individuals. We propose that marketing actions, such as changes in the price of a product, can affect neural representations of experienced pleasantness. We tested this hypothesis by scanning human subjects using functional MRI while they tasted wines that, contrary to reality, they believed to be different and sold at different prices. Our results show that increasing the price of a wine increases subjective reports of flavor pleasantness as well as blood-oxygen-level-dependent activity in medial orbitofrontal cortex, an area that is widely thought to encode for experienced pleasantness during experiential tasks. The paper provides evidence for the ability of marketing actions to modulate neural correlates of experienced pleasantness and for the mechanisms through which the effect operates.},

title = {Membrane potential has no direct role in evoking neurotransmitter release.},
abstract = {Neurons communicate by secreting a transmitter that excites or inhibits other neurons at synapses. The role of presynaptic membrane potential in triggering transmitter release is still controversial. In one view, presynaptic action potentials trigger the release by the entry of calcium ions into presynaptic terminals through voltage-dependent calcium channels. Calcium acts at high local concentrations at release sites near channel mouths to cause neurosecretion. An opposing view is that, in addition to elevating presynaptic calcium, presynaptic potential stimulates transmitter release by a distinct direct action. The relative importance of depolarization and calcium entry in neurosecretion cannot be determined because the two events are tightly linked. To delineate the roles of presynaptic potential and calcium entry in transmitter release, we have used nitr-5, a photolabile calcium chelator, and a voltage-clamp technique to control intracellular calcium and membrane potential independently at a synapse formed between cell bodies of cultured neurons of the fresh water snail Helisoma trivolvis. We found transmitter release occurred when presynaptic calcium levels were elevated to concentrations of a few micromolar, and that presynaptic voltage had no direct effect on neurosecretion.},

abstract = {Animals process information about many stimulus features simultaneously, swiftly (in a few 100 ms), and robustly (even when individual neurons do not themselves respond reliably). When the brain carries, codes, and certainly when it decodes information, it must do so through some coarse-grained projection mechanism. How can a projection retain information about network dynamics that covers multiple features, swiftly and robustly? Here, by a coarse-grained projection to event trees and to the event chains that comprise these trees, we propose a method of characterizing dynamic information of neuronal networks by using a statistical collection of spatial-temporal sequences of relevant physiological observables (such as sequences of spiking multiple neurons). We demonstrate, through idealized point neuron simulations in small networks, that this event tree analysis can reveal, with high reliability, information about multiple stimulus features within short realistic observation times. Then, with a large-scale realistic computational model of V1, we show that coarse-grained event trees contain sufficient information, again over short observation times, for fine discrimination of orientation, with results consistent with recent experimental observation.},

abstract = {Goal-directed behavior is believed to involve interactions of prefrontal cortical and limbic inputs in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), and their modulation by mesolimbic dopamine (DA) seems to be of primary importance in NAcc function. Using in vivo electrophysiological recordings simultaneously with DA system manipulation in rats, we show that tonic and phasic DA release selectively modulates hippocampal and prefrontal cortical inputs through D1 and D2 receptors, respectively. In addition, we also found that D1 activation and D2 inactivation in the NAcc produced behaviorally selective effects (learning versus set shifting of response strategy) that correspond to specific afferents. These results suggest that the dynamics of DA release regulate the balance between limbic and cortical drive through activation and inactivation of DA receptor subtypes in the accumbens, and this regulates goal-directed behavior.},

abstract = {Humans can acquire appropriate behaviors that maximize rewards on a trial-and-error basis. Recent electrophysiological and imaging studies have demonstrated that neural activity in the midbrain and ventral striatum encodes the error of reward prediction. However, it is yet to be examined whether the striatum is the main locus of reward-based behavioral learning. To address this, we conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of a stochastic decision task involving monetary rewards, in which subjects had to learn behaviors involving different task difficulties that were controlled by probability. We performed a correlation analysis of fMRI data by using the explanatory variables derived from subject behaviors. We found that activity in the caudate nucleus was correlated with short-term reward and, furthermore, paralleled the magnitude of a subject's behavioral change during learning. In addition, we confirmed that this parallelism between learning and activity in the caudate nucleus is robustly maintained even when we vary task difficulty by controlling the probability. These findings suggest that the caudate nucleus is one of the main loci for reward-based behavioral learning.},

Linear boundaries provided poor fits to the classification data in situations involving integral dimensions or when the boundary needed to be oriented in oblique directions in the space. The results were consistent with the selection-attention assumptions embodied in the exemplar model.

title = {Selective impairment of prediction error signaling in human dorsolateral but not ventral striatum in Parkinson's disease patients: evidence from a model-based fMRI study},
abstract = {Animal studies have found that the phasic activity of dopamine neurons during reward-related learning resembles a "prediction error" (PE) signal derived from a class of computational models called reinforcement learning (RL). An apparently similar signal can be measured using fMRI in the human striatum, a primary dopaminergic target. However, the fMRI signal does not measure dopamine per se, and therefore further evidence is needed to determine if these signals are related to each other. Parkinson's disease (PD) involves the neurodegeneration of the dopamine system and is accompanied by deficits in reward-related decision-making tasks. In the current study we used a computational RL model to assess striatal error signals in PD patients performing an RL task during fMRI scanning. Results show that error signals were preserved in ventral striatum of PD patients, but impaired in dorsolateral striatum, relative to healthy controls, a pattern reflecting the known selective anatomical degeneration of dopamine nuclei in PD. These findings support the notion that PE signals measured in the human striatum by the BOLD signal may reflect phasic DA activity. These results also provide evidence for a deficiency in PE signaling in the dorsolateral striatum of PD patients that may offer an explanation for their deficits observed in other reward learning tasks.},

We explored the potential value of neural networks for modeling and predicting human interactive learning in repeated games. We found that even very simple learning networks, driven by regret-based feedback, accurately predict observed human behavior in different experiments on 21 games with unique equilibria in mixed strategies. Introducing regret in the feedback dramatically improved the performance of the neural network. We show that regret-based models provide better predictions of learning than established economic models.},

abstract = {Majority of the brain dopamine (DA) neurons reside in a distinct area in the midbrain and project axons into the striatum and frontal cortex to control central nervous system (CNS) functions such as movement, motivation and mood. Age-associated specific loss of DA neurons particularly in the midbrain region substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) causes Parkinson disease (PD), an incurable condition characterized by rigidity, involuntary and slowed movement affecting about 1% of people over the age of 60 years. Dopamine neurons appear to be one of the most sensitive types of neurons to both intrinsic and extrinsic stressors in the brain. Here we summarize how transcription factors, growth factors and in particular neurotrophic factors are used to make and maintain DA neurons. We also discuss mechanisms that underlie their specific vulnerability and highlight current state of art in drug development.},

abstract = {Previous research on the superior temporal sulcus (STS) has shown that it responds more to facial expressions than to neutral faces. Here, we extend our understanding of the STS in two ways. First, using targeted high-resolution fMRI measurements of the lateral cortex and multivoxel pattern analysis, we show that the response to seven categories of dynamic facial expressions can be decoded in both the posterior STS (pSTS) and anterior STS (aSTS). We were also able to decode patterns corresponding to these expressions in the frontal operculum (FO), a structure that has also been shown to respond to facial expressions. Second, we measured the similarity structure of these representations and found that the similarity structure in the pSTS significantly correlated with the perceptual similarity structure of the expressions. This was the case regardless of whether we used pattern classification or more traditional correlation techniques to extract the neural similarity structure. These results suggest that distributed representations in the pSTS could underlie the perception of facial expressions.},

However, human studies have not yet characterized the response of the basal ganglia to an isolated reward, as has been done in animals. We developed an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm to identify brain areas that are activated after presentation of a reward. Subjects guessed whether the value of a card was higher or lower than the number 5, with monetary rewards as an incentive for correct guesses. They received reward, punishment, or neutral feedback on different trials. Regions in the dorsal and ventral striatum were activated by the paradigm, showing differential responses to reward and punishment. Activation was sustained following a reward feedback, but decreased below baseline following a punishment feedback.},

title = {Dopamine-dependent prediction errors underpin reward-seeking behaviour in humans},
abstract = {Theories of instrumental learning are centred on understanding how success and failure are used to improve future decisions. These theories highlight a central role for reward prediction errors in updating the values associated with available actions. In animals, substantial evidence indicates that the neurotransmitter dopamine might have a key function in this type of learning, through its ability to modulate cortico-striatal synaptic efficacy. However, no direct evidence links dopamine, striatal activity and behavioural choice in humans. Here we show that, during instrumental learning, the magnitude of reward prediction error expressed in the striatum is modulated by the administration of drugs enhancing (3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine; L-DOPA) or reducing (haloperidol) dopaminergic function. Accordingly, subjects treated with L-DOPA have a greater propensity to choose the most rewarding action relative to subjects treated with haloperidol. Furthermore, incorporating the magnitude of the prediction errors into a standard action-value learning algorithm accurately reproduced subjects' behavioural choices under the different drug conditions. We conclude that dopamine-dependent modulation of striatal activity can account for how the human brain uses reward prediction errors to improve future decisions.},

title = {Immediate changes in anticipatory activity of caudate neurons associated with reversal of position-reward contingency},
abstract = {The primate caudate nucleus plays a crucial role in transforming cognitive/motivational information into eye movement signals. A subset of caudate projection neurons fire before a visual target's onset. This anticipatory activity is sensitive to position-reward contingencies and correlates with saccade latency, which is shorter toward a rewarded position. We recorded single-unit activity of caudate projection neurons to examine the dynamics of change in anticipatory activity immediately after switches of the position-reward contingency. Two monkeys performed a visually guided saccade task where only one position was associated with reward. The position-reward mapping remained constant within a block, but was reversed frequently between blocks without any indication to the monkey. Therefore the switch could be detected only by unexpected reward delivery or unexpected lack of reward. After the switch, both saccade latency and anticipatory activity showed reliable changes already in the second trial, whether or not the first trial was rewarded. However, anticipatory activity in the second trial was generally higher if the first trial was rewarded, and the measured saccade latencies could be better explained by the difference in anticipatory activity between the two caudate nuclei. We suggest that anticipatory activity of caudate neurons reflects the reversal set of reward-position contingency.},

abstract = {2-Deoxy-D-[14C]glucose autoradiography was used in awake rats to map neural activity in the sensorimotor sector of striatum. Stimulation of hindlimb, trunk, or forelimb activated primary sensory cortex in a localized columnar pattern, indicating activation of somatosensory receptors and a discrete cortical functional unit. In sensorimotor striatum, an image analysis detection technique revealed regions of maximal activity, or features, that formed a patchy pattern of activation reminiscent of the known anatomic patterns of cortico-striate terminals. Ipsilateral as well as contralateral activation was observed. The activated areas revealed a body map in striatum that was organized in a manner consistent with cortical topography (dorsoventrally: hindlimb, trunk, forelimb) at most anteroposterior levels, similar to that found in other species. However, at other levels, a different organization (e.g., trunk, hindlimb, forelimb) was observed. Furthermore, the arrangements of body region and side were also unique at different anteroposterior levels. Thus, functional activity showed multiple, different juxtapositions of body elements--i.e., a combinational map. The data suggest that striatum may provide an anatomic substrate for different combinations of inputs necessary to select and integrate movement.},

abstract = {Modulation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity by estrogen has been attracting much attention. Thorns of thorny excrescences of CA3 hippocampal neurons are post-synaptic regions whose presynaptic partners are mossy fiber terminals. Here we demonstrated the rapid effect of estradiol on the density of thorns of thorny excrescences, by imaging Lucifer Yellow-injected CA3 neurons in adult male rat hippocampal slices. The application of 1 nM estradiol induced rapid decrease in the density of thorns on pyramidal neurons within 2 h. The estradiol-mediated decrease in the density of thorns was blocked by CNQX (AMPA receptor antagonist) and PD98059 (MAP kinase inhibitor), but not by MK-801 (NMDA receptor antagonist). ER{\$}[{\$}alpha{\$}]{\$} agonist PPT induced the same suppressive effect as that induced by estradiol on the density of thorns, but ER{\$}[{\$}beta{\$}]{\$} agonist DPN did not affect the density of thorns. Note that a 1 nM estradiol treatment did not affect the density of spines in the stratum radiatum and stratum oriens. A search for synaptic ER{\$}[{\$}alpha{\$}]{\$} was performed using purified RC-19 antibody. The localization of ER{\$}[{\$}alpha{\$}]{\$} (67 kDa) in the CA3 mossy fiber terminals and thorns was demonstrated using immunogold electron microscopy.

abstract = {How are different object categories organized by the visual system? Current evidence indicates that monkeys and humans process object categories in fundamentally different ways. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies suggest that humans have a ventral temporal face area, but such evidence is lacking in macaques. Instead, face-responsive neurons in macaques seem to be scattered throughout temporal cortex, with some relative concentration in the superior temporal sulcus (STS). Here, using fMRI in alert fixating macaque monkeys and humans, we found that macaques do have discrete face-selective patches, similar in relative size and number to face patches in humans. The face patches were embedded within a large swath of object-selective cortex extending from V4 to rostral TE. This large region responded better to pictures of intact objects compared to scrambled objects, with different object categories eliciting different patterns of activity, as in the human. Overall, our results suggest that humans and macaques share a similar brain architecture for visual object processing.},

abstract = {The mesostriatal dopamine system is prominently implicated in model-free reinforcement learning, with fMRI BOLD signals in ventral striatum notably covarying with model-free prediction errors. However, latent learning and devaluation studies show that behavior also shows hallmarks of model-based planning, and the interaction between model-based and model-free values, prediction errors, and preferences is underexplored. We designed a multistep decision task in which model-based and model-free influences on human choice behavior could be distinguished. By showing that choices reflected both influences we could then test the purity of the ventral striatal BOLD signal as a model-free report. Contrary to expectations, the signal reflected both model-free and model-based predictions in proportions matching those that best explained choice behavior. These results challenge the notion of a separate model-free learner and suggest a more integrated computational architecture for high-level human decision-making.},

title = {The effect of a serotonin-induced dissociation between spiking and perisynaptic activity on BOLD functional MRI},
abstract = {The relationship of the blood oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal to its underlying neuronal activity is still poorly understood. Combined physiology and functional MRI experiments suggested that local field potential (LFP) is a better predictor of the BOLD signal than multiunit activity (MUA). To further explore this relationship, we simultaneously recorded BOLD and electrophysiological activity while inducing a dissociation of MUA from LFP activity with injections of the neuromodulator BP554 into the primary visual cortex of anesthetized monkeys. BP554 is a 5-HT1A agonist acting primarily on the membrane of efferent neurons by potassium-induced hyperpolarization. Its infusion in visual cortex reliably reduced MUA without affecting either LFP or BOLD activity. This finding suggests that the efferents of a neuronal network pose relatively little metabolic burden compared with the overall presynaptic and postsynaptic processing of incoming afferents. We discuss implications of this finding for the interpretation of BOLD activity.},

abstract = {While most studies have focused on the role of long-term potentiation in behavior, far less is known about the role of long-term depression (LTD). To examine the potential involvement of LTD in learning and memory, we generated transgenic mice that express a fragment of the SV40 small t antigen known to inhibit protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Small t antigen expression blocked both stimulus-induced and chemically induced NMDAR-dependent LTD at Schaffer collateral synapses but did not affect potentiation, depotentiation, or mGluR-dependent LTD. This physiological phenotype was associated with deficits in behavioral flexibility in both the Morris water maze and a delayed nonmatch to place T-maze task, suggesting that NMDAR-dependent LTD is required for behavioral flexibility and may act by weakening previously encoded memory traces when new information is learned.},

title = {Storage, recall, and novelty detection of sequences by the hippocampus: elaborating on the SOCRATIC model to account for normal and aberrant effects of dopamine},
abstract = {In order to understand how the molecular or cellular defects that underlie a disease of the nervous system lead to the observable symptoms, it is necessary to develop a large-scale neural model. Such a model must specify how specific molecular processes contribute to neuronal function, how neurons contribute to network function, and how networks interact to produce behavior. This is a challenging undertaking, but some limited progress has been made in understanding the memory functions of the hippocampus with this degree of detail. There is increasing evidence that the hippocampus has a special role in the learning of sequences and the linkage of specific memories to context. In the first part of this paper, we review a model (the SOCRATIC model) that describes how the dentate and CA3 hippocampal regions could store and recall memory sequences in context. A major line of evidence for sequence recall is the "phase precession" of hippocampal place cells. In the second part of the paper, we review the evidence for theta-gamma phase coding. According to a framework that incorporates this form of coding, the phase precession is interpreted as cued recall of a discrete sequence of items from long-term memory. The third part of the paper deals with the issue of how the hippocampus could learn memory sequences. We show that if multiple items can be active within a theta cycle through the action of a short-term "buffer," NMDA-dependent plasticity can lead to the learning of sequences presented at realistic item separation intervals. The evidence for such a buffer function is reviewed. An important underlying issue is whether the hippocampal circuitry is configured differently for learning and recall. We argue that there are indeed separate states for learning and recall, but that both involve theta oscillations, albeit in possibly different forms. This raises the question of how neuromodulatory input might switch the hippocampus between learning and recall states and more generally how different neuromodulatory inputs reconfigure the hippocampus for different functions. In the fifth part of this paper we review our studies of dopamine and dopamine/NMDA interactions in the control of synaptic function. Our results show that dopamine dramatically reduces the direct cortical input to CA1 (the perforant path input), while having little effect on the input from CA3. In order to interpret the functional consequences of this pathway-specific modulation, it is necessary to understand the function of CA1 and the role of dopaminergic input from the ventral tegmental area (VTA). In the sixth part of this paper we consider several possibilities and address the issue of how dopamine hyperfunction or NMDA hypofunction, abnormalities that may underlie schizophrenia, might lead to the symptoms of the disease. Relevant to this issue is the demonstrated role of the hippocampus in novelty detection, a function that is likely to depend on sequence recall by the hippocampus. Novelty signals are generated when reality does not match the expectations generated by sequence recall. One possible site for computing mismatch is CA1, since it receives predictions from CA3 and sensory "reality" via the perforant path. Our data suggest that disruption of this comparison would be expected under conditions of dopamine hyperfunction or NMDA hypofunction. Also relevant is the fact that the VTA, which fires in response to novelty, may both depend on hippocampal-dependent novelty detection processes and, in turn, affect hippocampal function. Through large-scale modeling that considers both the processes performed by the hippocampus and the neuromodulatory loops in which the hippocampus is embedded, it is becoming possible to generate working hypotheses that relate synaptic function and malfunction to behavior.},

abstract = {The goal of this research was to further our understanding of how the striatum responds to the delivery of affective feedback. Previously, we had found that the striatum showed a pattern of sustained activation after presentation of a monetary reward, in contrast to a decrease in the hemodynamic response after a punishment. In this study, we tested whether the activity of the striatum could be modulated by parametric variations in the amount of financial reward or punishment. We used an event-related fMRI design in which participants received large or small monetary rewards or punishments after performance in a gambling task. A parametric ordering of conditions was observed in the dorsal striatum according to both magnitude and valence. In addition, an early response to the presentation of feedback was observed and replicated in a second experiment with increased temporal resolution. This study further implicates the dorsal striatum as an integral component of a reward circuitry responsible for the control of motivated behavior, serving to code for such feedback properties as valence and magnitude.},

In Experiment 1, we showed that both DAT KD mice and wild-type controls were similarly sensitive to outcome devaluation induced by sensory specific satiety, indicating normal action-outcome learning in both groups. In Experiment 2, we used a Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer procedure to assess the potentiation of instrumental responding by Pavlovian conditional stimuli (CS). Although during the Pavlovian training phase the DAT KD mice entered the food magazine more frequently in the absence of the CS, when tested later both groups showed outcome-selective PIT. These results suggest that the elevated dopaminergic tone reduced the selectivity of stimulus control over conditioned behavior, but did not affect instrumental learning.},

title = {A dopaminergic axon lattice in the striatum and its relationship with cortical and thalamic terminals},
abstract = {Interactions between glutamatergic corticostriatal afferents and dopaminergic nigrostriatal afferents are central to basal ganglia function. The thalamostriatal projection provides a glutamatergic innervation of similar magnitude to the corticostriatal projection. We tested the hypotheses that (1) thalamostriatal synapses have similar spatial relationships with dopaminergic axons as corticostriatal synapses do and (2) the spatial relationships between excitatory synapses and dopaminergic axons are selective associations. We examined at the electron microscopic level rat striatum immunolabeled to reveal vesicular glutamate transporters (VGluTs) 1 and 2, markers of corticostriatal and thalamostriatal terminals, respectively, together with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) to reveal dopaminergic axons. Over 80% of VGluT-positive synapses were within 1 microm of a TH-positive axon and >40% were within 1 microm of a TH-positive synapse. Of structures postsynaptic to VGluT1- or VGluT2-positive terminals, 21 and 27%, respectively, were apposed by a TH-positive axon and about half of these made synaptic contact. When structures postsynaptic to VGluT-positive terminals and VGluT-positive terminals themselves were normalized for length of plasma membrane, the probability of them being apposed by, or in synaptic contact with, a TH-positive axon was similar to that of randomly selected structures. Extrapolation of the experimental data to more closely reflect the distribution in 3D reveals that all structures in the striatum are within approximately 1 microm of a TH-positive synapse. We conclude that (1) thalamostriatal synapses are in a position to be influenced by released dopamine to a similar degree as corticostriatal synapses are and (2) these associations arise from a nonselective dopaminergic axon lattice.},

title = {Instrumental responding for rewards is associated with enhanced neuronal response in subcortical reward systems},
abstract = {The response of human reward systems to different reinforcers, including food, drugs and money, has been investigated in a number of recent functional neuroimaging studies. They have varied, however, in terms of whether or not a behavioural response was required to obtain rewards. The aim of the present study was to determine whether neuronal responses to financial reward are significantly modulated by the requirement to make a behavioural response. Twelve subjects were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing a simple target detection task. Certain targets acted as cues predicting financial reinforcement; some additionally required that a movement be executed, while others did not. There were also targets that required a movement but were not predictive of reward. We observed, as expected, responses within motor and reward systems associated with main effects of movement and reward, respectively. Critically, the reward responses were significantly modulated by the requirement to make an intervening behavioural response. Blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses in the amygdala and striatum were significantly enhanced when a movement was required, while reward-related response in the orbitofrontal cortex was independent of movement. These results suggest important dissociations within human reward systems, reflecting different properties of rewards. The striatum and amygdala may mediate the function of rewards in eliciting goal-directed behaviour, while the orbitofrontal cortex mediates incentive value.},

abstract = {Growing evidence from primate neurophysiology and modeling indicates that in reaction time tasks, a perceptual choice is made when the firing rate of a selective cortical neural population reaches a threshold. This raises two questions: what is the neural substrate of the threshold and how can it be adaptively tuned according to behavioral demands? Using a biophysically based network model of spiking neurons, we show that local dynamics in the superior colliculus gives rise to an all-or-none burst response that signals threshold crossing in upstream cortical neurons. Furthermore, the threshold level depends only weakly on the efficacy of the cortico-collicular pathway. In contrast, the threshold and the rate of reward harvest are sensitive to, and hence can be optimally tuned by, the strength of cortico-striatal synapses, which are known to be modifiable by dopamine-dependent plasticity. Our model provides a framework to describe the main computational steps in a reaction time task and suggests that separate brain pathways are critical to the detection and adjustment of a decision threshold.},

title = {Analysis of fMRI data by blind separation into independent spatial components},
abstract = {Current analytical techniques applied to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data require a priori knowledge or specific assumptions about the time courses of processes contributing to the measured signals. Here we describe a new method for analyzing fMRI data based on the independent component analysis (ICA) algorithm of Bell and Sejnowski ([1995]: Neural Comput 7:1129-1159). We decomposed eight fMRI data sets from 4 normal subjects performing Stroop color-naming, the Brown and Peterson work/number task, and control tasks into spatially independent components. Each component consisted of voxel values at fixed three-dimensional locations (a component "map"), and a unique associated time course of activation. Given data from 144 time points collected during a 6-min trial, ICA extracted an equal number of spatially independent components. In all eight trials, ICA derived one and only one component with a time course closely matching the time course of 40-sec alternations between experimental and control tasks. The regions of maximum activity in these consistently task-related components generally overlapped active regions detected by standard correlational analysis, but included frontal regions not detected by correlation. Time courses of other ICA components were transiently task-related, quasiperiodic, or slowly varying. By utilizing higher-order statistics to enforce successively stricter criteria for spatial independence between component maps, both the ICA algorithm and a related fourth-order decomposition technique (Comon [1994]: Signal Processing 36:11-20) were superior to principal component analysis (PCA) in determining the spatial and temporal extent of task-related activation. For each subject, the time courses and active regions of the task-related ICA components were consistent across trials and were robust to the addition of simulated noise. Simulated movement artifact and simulated task-related activations added to actual fMRI data were clearly separated by the algorithm. ICA can be used to distinguish between nontask-related signal components, movements, and other artifacts, as well as consistently or transiently task-related fMRI activations, based on only weak assumptions about their spatial distributions and without a priori assumptions about their time courses. ICA appears to be a highly promising method for the analysis of fMRI data from normal and clinical populations, especially for uncovering unpredictable transient patterns of brain activity associated with performance of psychomotor tasks.},

An unresolved question is how neural systems for reinforcement learning-such as prediction error signals for action valuation associated with dopamine and the striatum-can cope with this "curse of dimensionality." We propose a reinforcement learning framework that allows for learned action valuations to be decomposed into effector-specific components when appropriate to a task, and test it by studying to what extent human behavior and blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activity can exploit such a decomposition in a multieffector choice task. Subjects made simultaneous decisions with their left and right hands and received separate reward feedback for each hand movement. We found that choice behavior was better described by a learning model that decomposed the values of bimanual movements into separate values for each effector, rather than a traditional model that treated the bimanual actions as unitary with a single value. A decomposition of value into effector-specific components was also observed in value-related BOLD signaling, in the form of lateralized biases in striatal correlates of prediction error and anticipatory value correlates in the intraparietal sulcus. These results suggest that the human brain can use decomposed value representations to "divide and conquer" reinforcement learning over high-dimensional action spaces.},

title = {Signals in human striatum are appropriate for policy update rather than value prediction},
abstract = {Influential reinforcement learning theories propose that prediction error signals in the brain's nigrostriatal system guide learning for trial-and-error decision-making. However, since different decision variables can be learned from quantitatively similar error signals, a critical question is: what is the content of decision representations trained by the error signals? We used fMRI to monitor neural activity in a two-armed bandit counterfactual decision task that provided human subjects with information about forgone and obtained monetary outcomes so as to dissociate teaching signals that update expected values for each action, versus signals that train relative preferences between actions (a policy). The reward probabilities of both choices varied independently from each other. This specific design allowed us to test whether subjects' choice behavior was guided by policy-based methods, which directly map states to advantageous actions, or value-based methods such as Q-learning, where choice policies are instead generated by learning an intermediate representation (reward expectancy). Behaviorally, we found human participants' choices were significantly influenced by obtained as well as forgone rewards from the previous trial. We also found subjects' blood oxygen level-dependent responses in striatum were modulated in opposite directions by the experienced and forgone rewards but not by reward expectancy. This neural pattern, as well as subjects' choice behavior, is consistent with a teaching signal for developing habits or relative action preferences, rather than prediction errors for updating separate action values.},

title = {Separating processes within a trial in event-related functional MRI},
abstract = {Many cognitive processes occur on time scales that can significantly affect the shape of the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response in event-related functional MRI. This shape can be estimated from event related designs, even if these processes occur in a fixed temporal sequence (J. M. Ollinger, G. L. Shulman, and M. Corbetta. 2001. NeuroImage 13: 210-217). Several important considerations come into play when interpreting these time courses. First, in single subjects, correlations among neighboring time points give the noise a smooth appearance that can be confused with changes in the BOLD response. Second, the variance and degree of correlation among estimated time courses are strongly influenced by the timing of the experimental design. Simulations show that optimal results are obtained if the intertrial intervals are as short as possible, if they follow an exponential distribution with at least three distinct values, and if 40% of the trials are partial trials. These results are not particularly sensitive to the fraction of partial trials, so accurate estimation of time courses can be obtained with lower percentages of partial trials (20-25%). Third, statistical maps can be formed from F statistics computed with the extra sum of square principle or by t statistics computed from the cross-correlation of the time courses with a model for the hemodynamic response. The latter method relies on an accurate model for the hemodynamic response. The most robust model among those tested was a single gamma function. Finally, the power spectrum of the measured BOLD signal in rapid event-related paradigms is similar to that of the noise. Nevertheless, high-pass filtering is desirable if the appropriate model for the hemodynamic response is used.},

However, earlier models cannot account for recent results of conditioning experiments; specifically, the behavior of dopamine neurons in case of variation of the interval between a cue stimulus and a reward has not been satisfyingly accounted for. We address this problem by using a modular architecture, in which each module consists of a reward predictor and a value estimator. A "responsibility signal", computed from the accuracy of the predictions of the reward predictors, is used to weight the contributions and learning of the value estimators. This multiple-model architecture gives an accurate account of the behavior of dopamine neurons in two specific experiments: when the reward is delivered earlier than expected, and when the stimulus-reward interval varies uniformly over a fixed range.},

abstract = {The ability to retrieve and flexibly switch between task rules is seen as an important component of cognitive control. It is often assumed that lateral prefrontal cortex (latPFC) is important for switching between rules. However, activation associated with rule-switching is less reliably observed in latPFC than in medial PFC (specifically, pre-supplementary motor area). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that medial PFC is important for reconfiguration of task sets, whereas latPFC is important for retrieving, maintaining and implementing relevant rules (i.e. rule representation). Twenty young adults participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study in which they determined the correct response to a target stimulus on the basis of an instructional cue. For bivalent targets, the appropriate response depended on the currently relevant rule. In contrast, univalent targets were always associated with the same response. Brain regions of interest were characterized according to their responsiveness to bivalent and univalent targets, on both rule-switch and rule-repetition trials. The data support the hypothesis that rule representation and task-set reconfiguration are separable cognitive processes, associated with dissociable neural activation in latPFC and medial PFC, respectively. Activation profiles of posterior parietal cortex, basal ganglia and rostrolateral PFC are also examined and discussed.},

abstract = {We employed a novel event-related fMRI design and analysis technique to explore caudate nucleus contributions to spatial and nonspatial working memory. The spatial condition of a delayed-response task revealed greater mnemonic activation in four of six subjects when the delay period preceded immediately a probe stimulus requiring an overt motor response, as contrasted with a probe requiring no response. This effect was not seen in frontal or parietal cortical areas, and was seen in the caudate nucleus in a formally identical object condition in just one of six subjects. We hypothesized that this pattern of activity represented spatially dependent motor preparation. A second experiment confirmed this hypothesis: delay-period activity of the caudate nucleus showed greater time dependence in a task that featured spatial and motoric memory demands than in a comparable nonspatial task that featured the same response contingencies. These results suggest an important subcortical locus of the dissociation between spatial and nonspatial working memory, and a role for the human caudate nucleus in the integration of spatially coded mnemonic information with motor preparation to guide behavior.},

These methods provide partially overlapping perspectives, resulting in a gain in knowledge beyond the province of the individual method. A common aspect in this endeavor is the statistical analysis of the data acquired by different methods, especially regarding the encoding of information in unitary elements (single cell activity in neurophysiology, blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) activation of voxels in fMRI, magnetic field strength in MEG) and the decoding of information from ensembles. In this paper we illustrate the various approaches, their data analysis and possible applications to medicine in the context of operations in space.},

An identical algorithm learned to classify an image-based, view-dependent representation of the stimuli. High correlations were found between the confusability of object categories and the confusability of brain activity maps. This occurred even with the inclusion of multiple views of objects, and when the object classification model was tested with high spatial frequency ``line drawings'' of the stimuli. Consistent with a distributed representation of objects in VT cortex, the data indicate that object categories with shared image-based attributes have shared neural structure.},

Activation of the loop begins when the hippocampus detects newly arrived information that is not already stored in its long-term memory. The resulting novelty signal is conveyed through the subiculum, accumbens, and ventral pallidum to the VTA where it contributes (along with salience and goal information) to the novelty-dependent firing of these cells. In the upward arm of the loop, dopamine (DA) is released within the hippocampus; this produces an enhancement of LTP and learning. These findings support a model whereby the hippocampal-VTA loop regulates the entry of information into long-term memory.},

abstract = {Emerging experimental evidence suggests that both networks and their component neurons respond to similar inputs differently, depending on the state of network activity. The network state is determined by the intrinsic dynamical structure of the network and may change as a function of neuromodulation, the balance or stochasticity of synaptic inputs to the network, and the history of network activity. Much of the knowledge on state-dependent effects comes from comparisons of awake and sleep states of the mammalian brain. Yet, the mechanisms underlying these states are difficult to unravel. Several vertebrate and invertebrate studies have elucidated cellular and synaptic mechanisms of state dependence resulting from neuromodulation, sensory input, and experience. Recent studies have combined modeling and experiments to examine the computational principles that emerge when network state is taken into account; these studies are highlighted in this article. We discuss these principles in a variety of systems (mammalian, crustacean, and mollusk) to demonstrate the unifying theme of state dependence of network output.},

title = {History- and current instruction-based coding of forthcoming behavioral outcomes in the striatum},
abstract = {Animals optimize behaviors by predicting future critical events based on histories of actions and their outcomes. When behavioral outcomes like reward and aversion are signaled by current external cues, actions are directed to acquire the reward and avoid the aversion. The basal ganglia are thought to be the brain locus for reward-based adaptive action planning and learning. To understand the role of striatum in coding outcomes of forthcoming behavioral responses, we addressed two specific questions. First, how are the histories of reward and aversion used for encoding forthcoming outcomes in the striatum during a series of instructed behavioral responses? Second, how are the behavioral responses and their instructed outcomes represented in the striatum? We recorded discharges of 163 presumed projection neurons in the striatum while monkeys performed a visually instructed lever-release task for reward, aversion, and sound outcomes, whose occurrences could be estimated by their histories. Before outcome instruction, discharge rates of a subset of neurons activated in this epoch showed positive or negative regression slopes with reward history (24/44), that is, to the number of trials since the last reward trial, which changed in parallel with reward probability of current trials. The history effect was also observed for the aversion outcome but in far fewer neurons (3/44). Once outcomes were instructed in the same task, neurons selectively encoded the outcomes before and after behavioral responses (reward, 46/70; aversion, 6/70; sound, 6/70). The history- and current instruction-based coding of forthcoming behavioral outcomes in the striatum might underlie outcome-oriented behavioral modulation.},

title = {What is reinforced by phasic dopamine signals?},
abstract = {The basal ganglia have been associated with processes of reinforcement learning. A strong line of supporting evidence comes from the recording of dopamine (DA) neurones in behaving monkeys. Unpredicted, biologically salient events, including rewards cause a stereotypic short-latency (70-100 ms), short-duration (100-200 ms) burst of DA activity - the phasic response. This response is widely considered to represent reward prediction errors used as teaching signals in appetitive learning to promote actions that will maximise future reward acquisition. For DA signalling to perform this function, sensory processing afferent to DA neurones should discriminate unpredicted reward-related events. However, the comparative response latencies of DA neurones and orienting gaze-shifts indicate that phasic DA responses are triggered by pre-attentive sensory processing. Consequently, in circumstances where biologically salient events are both spatially and temporally unpredictable, it is unlikely their identity will be known at the time of DA signalling. The limited quality of afferent sensory processing and the precise timing of phasic DA signals, suggests that they may play a less direct role in 'Law of Effect' appetitive learning. Rather, the 'time-stamp' nature of the phasic response, in conjunction with the other signals likely to be present in the basal ganglia at the time of phasic DA input, suggests it may reinforce the discovery of unpredicted sensory events for which the organism is responsible. Furthermore, DA-promoted repetition of preceding actions/movements should enable the system to converge on those aspects of context and behavioural output that lead to the discovery of novel actions.},

abstract = {Humans and animals have the ability to predict future events, which they cultivate by continuously searching their environment for sources of predictive information. However, little is known about the neural systems that motivate this behavior. We hypothesized that information-seeking is assigned value by the same circuits that support reward-seeking, such that neural signals encoding reward prediction errors (RPEs) include analogous information prediction errors (IPEs). To test this, we recorded from neurons in the lateral habenula, a nucleus that encodes RPEs, while monkeys chose between cues that provided different chances to view information about upcoming rewards. We found that a subpopulation of lateral habenula neurons transmitted signals resembling IPEs, responding when reward information was unexpectedly cued, delivered or denied. These signals evaluated information sources reliably, even when the monkey's decisions did not. These neurons could provide a common instructive signal for reward-seeking and information-seeking behavior.},

title = {Negative reward signals from the lateral habenula to dopamine neurons are mediated by rostromedial tegmental nucleus in primates},
abstract = {Lateral habenula (LHb) neurons signal negative "reward-prediction errors" and inhibit midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons. Yet LHb neurons are largely glutamatergic, indicating that this inhibition may occur through an intermediate structure. Recent studies in rats have suggested a candidate for this role, the GABAergic rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), but this neural pathway has not yet been tested directly. We now show using electrophysiology and anatomic tracing that (1) the monkey has an inhibitory structure similar to the rat RMTg; (2) RMTg neurons receive excitatory input from the LHb, exhibit negative reward-prediction errors, and send axonal projections near DA soma; and (3) stimulating this structure inhibits DA neurons. Surprisingly, some RMTg neurons responded to reward cues earlier than the LHb, and carry "state-value" signals not found in DA neurons. Thus, our data suggest that the RMTg translates LHb reward-prediction errors (negative) into DA reward-prediction errors (positive), while transmitting additional motivational signals to non-DA networks.},

title = {BOLD coherence reveals segregated functional neural interactions when adapting to distinct torque perturbations},
abstract = {In the natural world, we experience and adapt to multiple extrinsic perturbations. This poses a challenge to neural circuits in discriminating between different context-appropriate responses. Using event-related fMRI, we characterized the neural dynamics involved in this process by randomly delivering a position- or velocity-dependent torque perturbation to subjects' arms during a target-capture task. Each perturbation was color-cued during movement preparation to provide contextual information. Although trajectories differed between perturbations, subjects significantly reduced error under both conditions. This was paralleled by reduced BOLD signal in the right dentate nucleus, the left sensorimotor cortex, and the left intraparietal sulcus. Trials included "NoGo" conditions to dissociate activity related to preparation from execution and adaptation. Subsequent analysis identified perturbation-specific neural processes underlying preparation ("NoGo") and adaptation ("Go") early and late into learning. Between-perturbation comparisons of BOLD magnitude revealed negligible differences for both preparation and adaptation trials. However, a network-level analysis of BOLD coherence revealed that by late learning, response preparation ("NoGo") was attributed to a relative focusing of coherence within cortical and basal ganglia networks in both perturbation conditions, demonstrating a common network interaction for establishing arbitrary visuomotor associations. Conversely, late-learning adaptation ("Go") was attributed to a focusing of BOLD coherence between a cortical-basal ganglia network in the viscous condition and between a cortical-cerebellar network in the positional condition. Our findings demonstrate that trial-to-trial acquisition of two distinct adaptive responses is attributed not to anatomically segregated regions, but to differential functional interactions within common sensorimotor circuits.},

abstract = {When studying complex cognitive tasks using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) one often encounters weak signal responses. These weak responses are corrupted by noise and artifacts of various sources. Preprocessing of the raw data before the application of test statistics helps to extract the signal and can vastly improve signal detection. Artifact sources and algorithms to handle them are discussed. In an empirical approach targeted to yield an optimal recovery of the hemodynamic response, we implemented a test bed for baseline correction and noise-filtering methods. A known signal is modulated onto foreground patches obtained from event-related fMRI experiments. Quantitative performance measures are defined to optimize the characteristics of a given filter and to compare their results. Marked improvements in the sensitivity and selectivity are achieved by optimized filtering. Examples using real data underline the usefulness of this preprocessing sequence.},

title = {Reward-related cortical inputs define a large striatal region in primates that interface with associative cortical connections, providing a substrate for incentive-based learning},
abstract = {The anterior cingulate and orbital cortices and the ventral striatum process different aspects of reward evaluation, whereas the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the dorsal striatum are involved in cognitive function. Collectively, these areas are critical to decision making. We mapped the striatal area that receives information about reward evaluation. We also explored the extent to which terminals from reward-related cortical areas converge in the striatum with those from cognitive regions. Using three-dimensional-rendered reconstructions of corticostriatal projection fields along with two-dimensional chartings, we demonstrate the reward and cognitive territories in the primate striatum and show the convergence between these cortical inputs. The results show two labeling patterns: a focal projection field that consists of densely distributed terminal patches, and a diffuse projection consisting of clusters of fibers, extending throughout a wide area of the striatum. Together, these projection fields demonstrate a remarkably large, rostral, reward-related striatal territory that reaches into the dorsal striatum. Fibers from different reward-processing and cognitive cortical areas occupy both separate and converging territories. Furthermore, the diffuse projection may serve a separate integrative function by broadly disseminating general cortical activity. These findings show that the rostral striatum is in a unique position to mediate different aspects of incentive learning. Furthermore, areas of convergence may be particularly sensitive to dopamine modulation during decision making and habit formation.},

abstract = {Dopamine shapes a wide variety of psychomotor functions. This is mainly accomplished by modulating cortical and thalamic glutamatergic signals impinging upon principal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the striatum. Several lines of evidence suggest that dopamine D1 receptor signaling enhances dendritic excitability and glutamatergic signaling in striatonigral MSNs, whereas D2 receptor signaling exerts the opposite effect in striatopallidal MSNs. The functional antagonism between these two major striatal dopamine receptors extends to the regulation of synaptic plasticity. Recent studies, using transgenic mice in which cells express D1 and D2 receptors, have uncovered unappreciated differences between MSNs that shape glutamatergic signaling and the influence of DA on synaptic plasticity. These studies have also shown that long-term alterations in dopamine signaling produce profound and cell-type-specific reshaping of corticostriatal connectivity and function.},

title = {From fear to safety and back: reversal of fear in the human brain},
abstract = {Fear learning is a rapid and persistent process that promotes defense against threats and reduces the need to relearn about danger. However, it is also important to flexibly readjust fear behavior when circumstances change. Indeed, a failure to adjust to changing conditions may contribute to anxiety disorders. A central, yet neglected aspect of fear modulation is the ability to flexibly shift fear responses from one stimulus to another if a once-threatening stimulus becomes safe or a once-safe stimulus becomes threatening. In these situations, the inhibition of fear and the development of fear reactions co-occur but are directed at different targets, requiring accurate responding under continuous stress. To date, research on fear modulation has focused mainly on the shift from fear to safety by using paradigms such as extinction, resulting in a reduction of fear. The aim of the present study was to track the dynamic shifts from fear to safety and from safety to fear when these transitions occur simultaneously. We used functional neuroimaging in conjunction with a fear-conditioning reversal paradigm. Our results reveal a unique dissociation within the ventromedial prefrontal cortex between a safe stimulus that previously predicted danger and a "naive" safe stimulus. We show that amygdala and striatal responses tracked the fear-predictive stimuli, flexibly flipping their responses from one predictive stimulus to another. Moreover, prediction errors associated with reversal learning correlated with striatal activation. These results elucidate how fear is readjusted to appropriately track environmental changes, and the brain mechanisms underlying the flexible control of fear.},

abstract = {To perform multiple movements in a preprogrammed order, the brain needs to compute both the visuospatial and temporal organization of such multiple movements. Previous studies revealed participation of the parietal and premotor areas in visuospatial processing, and of the supplementary motor and presupplementary motor areas in temporal structuring of multiple movements. In the basal ganglia, on the other hand, relatively little has been known about how the neuronal processing of the visuospatial and temporal structuring of multiple movements occurs. In the present study, monkeys performed combinations of hand movements, either a lever turn-lever turn or lever turn-button press. Combinations of the two movements were performed under visually instructed condition first, then under remembered condition. We found that activity of 43% (30/69) and 60% (42/69) of putamen neurons was selective to the preprogrammed combination of movements and to the direction of the first movement. The neurons preferring remembered condition were mainly observed in the dorsomedial part of the putamen, where most of neurons were also selective to both direction and combination of movements, while those in the ventrolateral part of the putamen were not selective to the instructed and remembered conditions. The results supported a hypothesis that the movement direction-selective and the movement combination-selective neuron activities in the striatum may play an indispensable role in the visuospatial and temporal organization of movements through the cortico-basal ganglia loop system.},

title = {Noise reduction in BOLD-based fMRI using component analysis},
abstract = {Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) were used to decompose the fMRI time series signal and separate the BOLD signal change from the structured and random noise. Rather than using component analysis to identify spatial patterns of activation and noise, the approach we took was to identify PCA or ICA components contributing primarily to the noise. These noise components were identified using an unsupervised algorithm that examines the Fourier decomposition of each component time series. Noise components were then removed before subsequent reconstruction of the time series data. The BOLD contrast sensitivity (CS(BOLD)), defined as the ability to detect a BOLD signal change in the presence of physiological and scanner noise, was then calculated for all voxels. There was an increase in CS(BOLD) values of activated voxels after noise reduction as a result of decreased image-to-image variability in the time series of each voxel. A comparison of PCA and ICA revealed significant differences in their treatment of both structured and random noise. ICA proved better for isolation and removal of structured noise, while PCA was superior for isolation and removal of random noise. This provides a framework for using and evaluating component analysis techniques for noise reduction in fMRI.},

title = {Instrumental responding for rewards is associated with enhanced neuronal response in subcortical reward systems},
abstract = {The response of human reward systems to different reinforcers, including food, drugs and money, has been investigated in a number of recent functional neuroimaging studies. They have varied, however, in terms of whether or not a behavioural response was required to obtain rewards. The aim of the present study was to determine whether neuronal responses to financial reward are significantly modulated by the requirement to make a behavioural response. Twelve subjects were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing a simple target detection task. Certain targets acted as cues predicting financial reinforcement; some additionally required that a movement be executed, while others did not. There were also targets that required a movement but were not predictive of reward. We observed, as expected, responses within motor and reward systems associated with main effects of movement and reward, respectively. Critically, the reward responses were significantly modulated by the requirement to make an intervening behavioural response. Blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses in the amygdala and striatum were significantly enhanced when a movement was required, while reward-related response in the orbitofrontal cortex was independent of movement. These results suggest important dissociations within human reward systems, reflecting different properties of rewards. The striatum and amygdala may mediate the function of rewards in eliciting goal-directed behaviour, while the orbitofrontal cortex mediates incentive value.},

title = {How much of reinforcement learning is working memory, not reinforcement learning? A behavioral, computational, and neurogenetic analysis},
abstract = {Instrumental learning involves corticostriatal circuitry and the dopaminergic system. This system is typically modeled in the reinforcement learning (RL) framework by incrementally accumulating reward values of states and actions. However, human learning also implicates prefrontal cortical mechanisms involved in higher level cognitive functions. The interaction of these systems remains poorly understood, and models of human behavior often ignore working memory (WM) and therefore incorrectly assign behavioral variance to the RL system. Here we designed a task that highlights the profound entanglement of these two processes, even in simple learning problems. By systematically varying the size of the learning problem and delay between stimulus repetitions, we separately extracted WM-specific effects of load and delay on learning. We propose a new computational model that accounts for the dynamic integration of RL and WM processes observed in subjects' behavior. Incorporating capacity-limited WM into the model allowed us to capture behavioral variance that could not be captured in a pure RL framework even if we (implausibly) allowed separate RL systems for each set size. The WM component also allowed for a more reasonable estimation of a single RL process. Finally, we report effects of two genetic polymorphisms having relative specificity for prefrontal and basal ganglia functions. Whereas the COMT gene coding for catechol-O-methyl transferase selectively influenced model estimates of WM capacity, the GPR6 gene coding for G-protein-coupled receptor 6 influenced the RL learning rate. Thus, this study allowed us to specify distinct influences of the high-level and low-level cognitive functions on instrumental learning, beyond the possibilities offered by simple RL models.},

title = {Comparison of detrending methods for optimal fMRI preprocessing},
abstract = {Because of the inherently low signal to noise ratio (SNR) of fMRI data, removal of low frequency signal intensity drift is an important preprocessing step, particularly in those brain regions that weakly activate. Two known sources of drift are noise from the MR scanner and aliasing of physiological pulsations. However, the amount and direction of drift is difficult to predict, even between neighboring voxels. Further, there is no concensus on an optimal baseline drift removal algorithm. In this paper, five voxel-based detrending techniques were compared to each other and an auto-detrending algorithm, which automatically selected the optimal method for a given voxel time-series. For a significance level of P < 10(-6), linear and quadratic detrending moderately increased the percentage of activated voxels. Cubic detrending decreased activation, while a wavelet approach increased or decreased activation, depending on the dataset. Spline detrending was the best single algorithm. However, auto-detrending (selecting the best algorithm or none, if detrending is not useful) appears to be the most judicious choice, particularly for analyzing fMRI data with weak activations in the presence of baseline drift.},

title = {Humans Can Adopt Optimal Discounting Strategy under Real-Time Constraints},
abstract = {Critical to our many daily choices between larger delayed rewards, and smaller more immediate rewards, are the shape and the steepness of the function that discounts rewards with time. Although research in artificial intelligence favors exponential discounting in uncertain environments, studies with humans and animals have consistently shown hyperbolic discounting. We investigated how humans perform in a reward decision task with temporal constraints, in which each choice affects the time remaining for later trials, and in which the delays vary at each trial. We demonstrated that most of our subjects adopted exponential discounting in this experiment. Further, we confirmed analytically that exponential discounting, with a decay rate comparable to that used by our subjects, maximized the total reward gain in our task. Our results suggest that the particular shape and steepness of temporal discounting is determined by the task that the subject is facing, and question the notion of hyperbolic reward discounting as a universal principle.},

title = {Comparison of population activity in the dorsal premotor cortex and putamen during the learning of arbitrary visuomotor mappings},
abstract = {A previous study found that as monkeys learned novel mappings between visual cues and responses, neuronal activity patterns evolved at approximately the same time in both the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) and the putamen. Here we report that, in both regions, the population activity for novel mappings came to resemble that for familiar ones as learning progressed. Both regions showed activity differences on trials with correct responses versus those with incorrect ones. In addition to these common features, we observed two noteworthy differences between PMd and putamen activity during learning. After a response choice had been made, but prior to feedback about the correctness of that choice (reward or nonreward), the putamen showed a sustained activity increase in activity, whereas PMd did not. Also in the putamen, this prereward activity was highly selective for the specific visuomotor mapping that had just been performed, and this selectivity was maintained until the time of the reward. After performance reached an asymptote, the degree of this selectivity decreased markedly to the level typical for familiar visuomotor mappings. These findings support the hypothesis that neurons in the striatum play a pivotal role in associative learning.},

abstract = {In vivo experience can occlude subsequent induction of long-term potentiation and enhance long-term depression of synaptic responses. Although a reduced capacity for synaptic strengthening may function to prevent excessive excitation, such an effect paradoxically implies that continued experience or training should not improve and may even degrade neural representations. In mice, we examined the effect of ongoing whisker stimulation on synaptic strengthening at layer 4-2/3 synapses in the barrel cortex. Although N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors were required to initiate strengthening, they subsequently suppressed further potentiation at these synapses in vitro and in vivo. Despite this transition, synaptic strengthening continued with additional sensory activity but instead required the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors, suggesting a mechanism by which continued experience can result in increasing synaptic strength over time.},

title = {Diffusional Trapping of GluR1 AMPA Receptors by Input-Specific Synaptic Activity},
abstract = {Summary Synaptic activity regulates the postsynaptic accumulation of AMPA receptors over timescales ranging from minutes to days. Indeed, the regulated trafficking and mobility of GluR1 AMPA receptors underlies many forms of synaptic potentiation at glutamatergic synapses throughout the brain. However, the basis for synapse-specific accumulation of GluR1 is unknown. Here we report that synaptic activity locally immobilizes GluR1 AMPA receptors at individual synapses. Using single-molecule tracking together with the silencing of individual presynaptic boutons, we demonstrate that local synaptic activity reduces diffusional exchange of GluR1 between synaptic and extraynaptic domains, resulting in postsynaptic accumulation of GluR1. At neighboring inactive synapses, GluR1 is highly mobile with individual receptors frequently escaping the synapse. Within the synapse, spontaneous activity confines the diffusional movement of GluR1 to restricted subregions of the postsynaptic membrane. Thus, local activity restricts GluR1 mobility on a submicron scale, defining an input-specific mechanism for regulating AMPA receptor composition and abundance.},

These methods provide partially overlapping perspectives, resulting in a gain in knowledge beyond the province of the individual method. A common aspect in this endeavor is the statistical analysis of the data acquired by different methods, especially regarding the encoding of information in unitary elements (single cell activity in neurophysiology, blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) activation of voxels in fMRI, magnetic field strength in MEG) and the decoding of information from ensembles. In this paper we illustrate the various approaches, their data analysis and possible applications to medicine in the context of operations in space.},

This enhancement can outlast the exploration phase by several minutes. Currently, little is known about dopaminergic novelty processing and its relationship to hippocampal function in humans. In two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, SN/VTA activations in humans were indeed driven by stimulus novelty rather than other forms of stimulus salience such as rareness, negative emotional valence, or targetness of familiar stimuli, whereas hippocampal responses were less selective. SN/VTA novelty responses were scaled according to absolute rather than relative novelty in a given context, unlike adaptive SN/VTA responses recently reported for reward outcome in animal studies. Finally, novelty enhanced learning and perirhinal/parahippocampal processing of familiar items presented in the same context. Thus, the human SN/VTA can code absolute stimulus novelty and might contribute to enhancing learning in the context of novelty.},

title = {Conditional visuo-motor learning and dimension reduction},
abstract = {Conditional visuo-motor learning consists in learning by trial and error to associate visual cues with correct motor responses, that have no direct link. Converging evidence supports the role of a large brain network in this type of learning, including the prefrontal and the premotor cortex, the basal ganglia BG and the hippocampus. In this paper we focus on the role of a major structure of the BG, the striatum. We first present behavioral results and electrophysiological data recorded from this structure in monkeys engaged in learning new visuo-motor associations. Visual stimuli were presented on a video screen and the animals had to learn, by trial and error, to select the correct movement of a joystick, in order to receive a liquid reward. Behavioral results revealed that the monkeys used a sequential strategy, whereby they learned the associations one by one although they were presented randomly. Human subjects, tested on the same task, also used a sequential strategy. Neuronal recordings in monkeys revealed learning-related modulations of neural activity in the striatum. We then present a mathematical model inspired by viability theory developed to implement the use of strategies during learning. This model complements existing models of the BG based on reinforcement learning RL, which do not take into account the use of strategies to reduce the dimension of the learning space.},

title = {Human category learning 2.0},
abstract = {During the 1990s and early 2000s, cognitive neuroscience investigations of human category learning focused on the primary goal of showing that humans have multiple category-learning systems and on the secondary goals of identifying key qualitative properties of each system and of roughly mapping out the neural networks that mediate each system. Many researchers now accept the strength of the evidence supporting multiple systems, and as a result, during the past few years, work has begun on the second generation of research questions-that is, on questions that begin with the assumption that humans have multiple category-learning systems. This article reviews much of this second generation of research. Topics covered include (1) How do the various systems interact? (2) Are there different neural systems for categorization and category representation? (3) How does automaticity develop in each system? and (4) Exactly how does each system learn?},

abstract = {We examined interactions between frontal, striatal, and hippocampal systems during a rule-learning task. Nineteen healthy young adults solved multiple rule-learning problems requiring hypothesis testing while functional magnetic resonance images were obtained. Activity in the head of the caudate peaked early after the beginning of each problem and then dropped rapidly. In contrast, activity in prefrontal cortex areas reached peak values later. These results are in accordance with theories suggesting that the striatum identifies the behavioral context necessary for the frontal lobe to select an appropriate strategy. Striatal and hippocampal systems showed antagonistic patterns of activity: Activation in the anterior hippocampus decreased, whereas caudate activity increased. Good learners showed higher activity in the body and tail of the caudate than poor learners, whereas learning success correlated negatively with activity in the hippocampus. Activation in the head of the caudate correlated negatively with hippocampal activation, indicating a potential mechanism for hippocampal activity reduction.},

title = {A comparison of methods for characterizing the event-related BOLD timeseries in rapid fMRI},
abstract = {Information about the shape and temporal duration of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response can inform both functional neuroanatomy and psychological theory. However, the BOLD response evolves over 20 s or more, making it difficult to distinguish the unique characteristics of the response evoked by temporally adjacent stimuli. Fortunately, event-related BOLD signals can be extracted given that there is adequate variance in the distribution of inter-stimulus intervals (ISI). Unfortunately, the ISI distribution that yields the highest statistical efficiency is not always optimal from a psychological perspective; variability in the stimulus timing may complicate the interpretation of neuroimaging data in terms of underlying cognitive operations. In the present paper, Monte Carlo simulations are used to evaluate two techniques for estimating the event-related BOLD timeseries-event-related averaging and deconvolution using the Ordinary Least Squares estimate -with respect to maintaining acceptable levels of statistical power and experimental validity. While the unbiased deconvolution technique more robustly estimates the shape of the BOLD response functions, both methods succeed in accurately re-producing known differences between evoked BOLD responses when the stimulus ordering is randomized. However, the deconvolution method is more effective at preserving differences when there are sequential dependencies in the stimulus presentation order and restricted ISI distributions are used; particularly if the second of two sequentially dependent stimuli is omitted on some portion of the trials. Importantly, the successful re-production of the evoked BOLD response using restricted ISI distributions often maximizes the ability to make psychologically valid experimental conclusions.},

abstract = {Much is known about how people make decisions under varying levels of probability (risk). Less is known about the neural basis of decision-making when probabilities are uncertain because of missing information (ambiguity). In decision theory, ambiguity about probabilities should not affect choices. Using functional brain imaging, we show that the level of ambiguity in choices correlates positively with activation in the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex, and negatively with a striatal system. Moreover, striatal activity correlates positively with expected reward. Neurological subjects with orbitofrontal lesions were insensitive to the level of ambiguity and risk in behavioral choices. These data suggest a general neural circuit responding to degrees of uncertainty, contrary to decision theory.},

title = {Analyzing functional connectivity using a network likelihood model of ensemble neural spiking activity},
abstract = {Analyzing the dependencies between spike trains is an important step in understanding how neurons work in concert to represent biological signals. Usually this is done for pairs of neurons at a time using correlation-based techniques. Chornoboy, Schramm, and Karr (1988) proposed maximum likelihood methods for the simultaneous analysis of multiple pair-wise interactions among an ensemble of neurons. One of these methods is an iterative, continuous-time estimation algorithm for a network likelihood model formulated in terms of multiplicative conditional intensity functions. We devised a discrete-time version of this algorithm that includes a new, efficient computational strategy, a principled method to compute starting values, and a principled stopping criterion. In an analysis of simulated neural spike trains from ensembles of interacting neurons, the algorithm recovered the correct connectivity matrices and interaction parameters. In the analysis of spike trains from an ensemble of rat hippocampal place cells, the algorithm identified a connectivity matrix and interaction parameters consistent with the pattern of conjoined firing predicted by the overlap of the neurons' spatial receptive fields. These results suggest that the network likelihood model can be an efficient tool for the analysis of ensemble spiking activity.},

abstract = {Modulation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity by estrogen has been attracting much attention. Thorns of thorny excrescences of CA3 hippocampal neurons are post-synaptic regions whose presynaptic partners are mossy fiber terminals. Here we demonstrated the rapid effect of estradiol on the density of thorns of thorny excrescences, by imaging Lucifer Yellow-injected CA3 neurons in adult male rat hippocampal slices. The application of 1 nM estradiol induced rapid decrease in the density of thorns on pyramidal neurons within 2 h. The estradiol-mediated decrease in the density of thorns was blocked by CNQX (AMPA receptor antagonist) and PD98059 (MAP kinase inhibitor), but not by MK-801 (NMDA receptor antagonist). ER{\$}[{\$}alpha{\$}]{\$} agonist PPT induced the same suppressive effect as that induced by estradiol on the density of thorns, but ER{\$}[{\$}beta{\$}]{\$} agonist DPN did not affect the density of thorns. Note that a 1 nM estradiol treatment did not affect the density of spines in the stratum radiatum and stratum oriens. A search for synaptic ER{\$}[{\$}alpha{\$}]{\$} was performed using purified RC-19 antibody. The localization of ER{\$}[{\$}alpha{\$}]{\$} (67 kDa) in the CA3 mossy fiber terminals and thorns was demonstrated using immunogold electron microscopy.

title = {Shaping of motor responses by incentive values through the basal ganglia},
abstract = {The striatum is a key neural interface for cognitive and motor information processing in which associations between reward value and visual stimulus can be used to modify motor commands. It can guide action-selection processes that occur farther downstream in the basal ganglia (BG) circuit, by encoding the reward value of an action. Here, we report on the study of simultaneously recorded neurons in the dorsal striatum (input stage of the BG) and the internal pallidum (output stage of the BG) in two monkeys performing a center-out motor task in which the visual targets were associated with different reward probabilities. We show that the tuning curves of motor-related neurons in both structures are modulated by the value of the action before movement initiation and during its execution. The representations of values associated with different actions change dynamically during the task in the internal globus pallidus, with a significant increase in the number of encoding neurons for the chosen target at the onset of movement. This report sheds additional light on the functional differences between the input and output structures of the BG and supports the assertion that the dorsal basal ganglia are involved in movement-related decision-making processes based on incentive values.},

Here, we show that individual differences in extraversion and the presence of the A1 allele on the dopamine D2 receptor gene predict activation magnitudes in the brain's reward system during a gambling task. In two functional MRI experiments, participants probabilistically received rewards either immediately following a behavioral response (Study 1) or after a 7.5 s anticipation period (Study 2). Although group activation maps revealed anticipation- and reward-related activations in the reward system, individual differences in extraversion and the presence of the D2 Taq1A allele predicted a significant amount of inter-subject variability in the magnitudes of reward-related, but not anticipation-related, activations. These results demonstrate a link between stable differences in personality, genetics, and brain functioning.},

title = {Gene selection from microarray data for cancer classification--a machine learning approach},
abstract = {A DNA microarray can track the expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously. Previous research has demonstrated that this technology can be useful in the classification of cancers. Cancer microarray data normally contains a small number of samples which have a large number of gene expression levels as features. To select relevant genes involved in different types of cancer remains a challenge. In order to extract useful gene information from cancer microarray data and reduce dimensionality, feature selection algorithms were systematically investigated in this study. Using a correlation-based feature selector combined with machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, na{\"\i}ve Bayes and support vector machines, we show that classification performance at least as good as published results can be obtained on acute leukemia and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma microarray data sets. We also demonstrate that a combined use of different classification and feature selection approaches makes it possible to select relevant genes with high confidence. This is also the first paper which discusses both computational and biological evidence for the involvement of zyxin in leukaemogenesis.},

title = {Reward value coding distinct from risk attitude-related uncertainty coding in human reward systems},
abstract = {When deciding between different options, individuals are guided by the expected (mean) value of the different outcomes and by the associated degrees of uncertainty. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify brain activations coding the key decision parameters of expected value (magnitude and probability) separately from uncertainty (statistical variance) of monetary rewards. Participants discriminated behaviorally between stimuli associated with different expected values and uncertainty. Stimuli associated with higher expected values elicited monotonically increasing activations in distinct regions of the striatum, irrespective of different combinations of magnitude and probability. Stimuli associated with higher uncertainty (variance) elicited increasing activations in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex. Uncertainty-related activations covaried with individual risk aversion in lateral orbitofrontal regions and risk-seeking in more medial areas. Furthermore, activations in expected value-coding regions in prefrontal cortex covaried differentially with uncertainty depending on risk attitudes of individual participants, suggesting that separate prefrontal regions are involved in risk aversion and seeking. These data demonstrate the distinct coding in key reward structures of the two basic and crucial decision parameters, expected value, and uncertainty.},

title = {Time-specific contribution of the supplementary motor area to intermanual transfer of procedural knowledge},
abstract = {The supplementary motor area (SMA) makes a crucial contribution to intermanual transfer: the ability to use one hand to perform a skill practiced and learned with the other hand. However, the timing of this contribution relative to movement remains unknown. Here, 33 healthy volunteers performed a 12 item sequence in the serial reaction time task. During training, each participant responded to a sequence of visual cues presented at 1 Hz by pressing one of four keys with their right hand. The measure of intermanual transfer was response time (RT) during repetition of the trained sequence with the left hand, which was at rest during learning. Participants were divided into three groups, which did not differ in their learning rates or amounts. In two groups, 1 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation induced transient virtual lesions of the SMA during training, either 100 ms before each cue (the premovement group) or during each key press (the movement group). The third group received sham stimulation (the sham group). After training with the right hand, RTs for performance with the left (transfer) hand were longer for the premovement group than for the movement or sham groups. Thus, the most crucial contribution of SMA to intermanual transfer occurs in the interval between movements, when the memory of a previous movement plays a role in encoding specific sequences. These results provide insight into frontal lobe contributions to procedural knowledge.},

Not really relevant to VM stuff (at least with our design.  though perhaps we may see increasing preSMA activity with longer jitter (pre resp), that is if preSMA timing dependence is more WM and less "encoding".

abstract = {Many neurons exhibit subthreshold membrane-potential resonances, such that the largest voltage responses occur at preferred stimulation frequencies. As subthreshold resonances are known to infuence the rhythmic activity at the network level, it is vital to understand how they affect spike generation on the single-cell level. We therefore investigated resonant as well as nonresonant neurons of rat entorhinal cortex. A minimal resonate-and-fire type model based on measured physiological parameters captures fundamental properties of neuronal firing statistics surprisingly well and helps to shed light on the mechanisms that shape spike patterns: (i) subthreshold resonance together with a spike-induced reset of subthreshold oscillations leads to spike clustering, (ii) spike-induced dynamics infuence the fne structure of interspike interval (ISI) distributions and are responsible for ISI correlations appearing at higher fring rates (3 Hz). Both mechanisms are likely to account for the specifc discharge characteristics of various cell types.},

title = {Principal neuron spiking: neither necessary nor sufficient for cerebral blood flow in rat cerebellum},
abstract = {Neuronal activity, cerebral blood flow, and metabolic responses are all strongly coupled, although the mechanisms behind the coupling remain unclear. One of the key questions is whether or not increases in spiking activity in the stimulated neurons are sufficient to drive the activity-dependent rises in cerebral blood flow (CBF) that form the basis of the signals used in functional neuroimaging such as the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal. To this end the present study examined the effect of enhanced spike activity per se on CBF in rat cerebellar cortex under conditions of disinhibition, achieved by blocking GABA(A) receptors using either bicuculline or picrotoxin. Purkinje cell spiking activity and local field potentials were recorded by glass microelectrodes, and laser Doppler flowmetry was used to monitor CBF. Disinhibition increased Purkinje cell spiking rate to 200-300% of control without incurring any increase in basal CBF. This demonstrates that increased spike activity per se is not sufficient to affect basal CBF. The neurovascular coupling between excitatory synaptic activity and CBF responses evoked by inferior olive (climbing fibre) stimulation was preserved during disinhibition. Thus, the unchanged basal CBF in the presence of the dramatic rise in Purkinje cell spiking rate was not explained by impaired synaptic activity-CBF coupling. On the basis of our previous and the present studies, we conclude that increased spiking activity of principal neurons is neither sufficient nor necessary to elicit CBF responses and in turn BOLD signals, and that activation-dependent vascular signals reflect excitatory synaptic activity.},

In order to interpret changes in imaging signals over time, for example, in patient studies, the long-term reliability of fMRI must first be established. Here, eight healthy adult subjects were scanned on two sessions, 1 year apart, while performing a classification learning task known to activate frontostriatal circuitry. We show that behavioral performance and frontostriatal activation were highly concordant at a group level at both time-points. Furthermore, intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs), which index the degree of correlation between subjects at different time-points, were high for behavior and for functional activation. ICC was significantly higher within the network recruited by learning than outside that network. We conclude that fMRI can have high long-term test-retest reliability, making it suitable as a biomarker for brain development and neurodegeneration.},

A basic phenomenon, defying explanation by traditional decision theories, is that people often overweigh small and underweigh large probabilities in choices under uncertainty. However, the neuronal basis of such reward probability distortions and their position in the decision process are largely unknown. We assessed individual probability distortions with behavioral pleasantness ratings and brain imaging in the absence of choice. Dorsolateral frontal cortex regions showed experience dependent overweighting of small, and underweighting of large, probabilities whereas ventral frontal regions showed the opposite pattern. These results demonstrate distorted neuronal coding of reward probabilities in the absence of choice, stress the importance of experience with probabilistic outcomes and contrast with linear probability coding in the striatum. Input of the distorted probability estimations to decision-making mechanisms are likely to contribute to well known inconsistencies in preferences formalized in theories of behavioral economics.},

title = {Brain mechanism of reward prediction under predictable and unpredictable environmental dynamics},
abstract = {In learning goal-directed behaviors, an agent has to consider not only the reward given at each state but also the consequences of dynamic state transitions associated with action selection. To understand brain mechanisms for action learning under predictable and unpredictable environmental dynamics, we measured brain activities by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a Markov decision task with predictable and unpredictable state transitions. Whereas the striatum and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) were significantly activated both under predictable and unpredictable state transition rules, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was more strongly activated under predictable than under unpredictable state transition rules. We then modelled subjects' choice behaviours using a reinforcement learning model and a Bayesian estimation framework and found that the subjects took larger temporal discount factors under predictable state transition rules. Model-based analysis of fMRI data revealed different engagement of striatum in reward prediction under different state transition dynamics. The ventral striatum was involved in reward prediction under both unpredictable and predictable state transition rules, although the dorsal striatum was dominantly involved in reward prediction under predictable rules. These results suggest different learning systems in the cortico-striatum loops depending on the dynamics of the environment: the OFC-ventral striatum loop is involved in action learning based on the present state, while the DLPFC-dorsal striatum loop is involved in action learning based on predictable future states.},

title = {Bayesian analysis of interleaved learning and response bias in behavioral experiments},
abstract = {Accurate characterizations of behavior during learning experiments are essential for understanding the neural bases of learning. Whereas learning experiments often give subjects multiple tasks to learn simultaneously, most analyze subject performance separately on each individual task. This analysis strategy ignores the true interleaved presentation order of the tasks and cannot distinguish learning behavior from response preferences that may represent a subject's biases or strategies. We present a Bayesian analysis of a state-space model for characterizing simultaneous learning of multiple tasks and for assessing behavioral biases in learning experiments with interleaved task presentations. Under the Bayesian analysis the posterior probability densities of the model parameters and the learning state are computed using Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods. Measures of learning, including the learning curve, the ideal observer curve, and the learning trial translate directly from our previous likelihood-based state-space model analyses. We compare the Bayesian and current likelihood-based approaches in the analysis of a simulated conditioned T-maze task and of an actual object-place association task. Modeling the interleaved learning feature of the experiments along with the animal's response sequences allows us to disambiguate actual learning from response biases. The implementation of the Bayesian analysis using the WinBUGS software provides an efficient way to test different models without developing a new algorithm for each model. The new state-space model and the Bayesian estimation procedure suggest an improved, computationally efficient approach for accurately characterizing learning in behavioral experiments.},

title = {Temporal prediction errors in a passive learning task activate human striatum},
abstract = {Functional MRI experiments in human subjects strongly suggest that the striatum participates in processing information about the predictability of rewarding stimuli. However, stimuli can be unpredictable in character (what stimulus arrives next), unpredictable in time (when the stimulus arrives), and unpredictable in amount (how much arrives). These variables have not been dissociated in previous imaging work in humans, thus conflating possible interpretations of the kinds of expectation errors driving the measured brain responses. Using a passive conditioning task and fMRI in human subjects, we show that positive and negative prediction errors in reward delivery time correlate with BOLD changes in human striatum, with the strongest activation lateralized to the left putamen. For the negative prediction error, the brain response was elicited by expectations only and not by stimuli presented directly; that is, we measured the brain response to nothing delivered (juice expected but not delivered) contrasted with nothing delivered (nothing expected).},

abstract = {Associative learning theory assumes that prediction error is a driving force in learning. A competing view, probabilistic contrast (PC) theory, is that learning and prediction error are unrelated. We tested a learning phenomenon that has proved troublesome for associative theory--retrospective revaluation--to evaluate these two models. We previously showed that activation in right lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) provides a reliable signature for the presence of prediction error. Thus, if the associative view is correct, retrospective revaluation should be accompanied by right lateral PFC activation. PC theory would be supported by the absence of this activation. Right PFC and ventral striatal activation occurred during retrospective revaluation, supporting the associative account. Activations appeared to reflect the degree of revaluation, predicting later brain responses to revalued cues. Our results support a modified associative account of retrospective revaluation and demonstrate the potential of functional neuroimaging as a tool for evaluating competing learning models.},

abstract = {The nucleus accumbens is involved in the modulation of motivated behaviour by reward-associated sensory information. However, little is known about the specific nature of the nucleus accumbens' contribution to generating movement. We investigated motor encoding by nucleus accumbens neurons in rats performing a delayed response task that allowed us to dissociate the effects of sensory and motor events on firing. In a subset of neurons, firing in the delay period preceding movement was highly selective; this selectivity was tightly correlated with the direction of the subsequent movement, but not with the sensory properties of the instructive cue. Direction selectivity in this population of neurons developed over the course of the delay period, with the strongest selectivity apparent just prior to movement onset. Selectivity was also apparent in nucleus accumbens neurons during movement, such that firing showed a tight correlation with movement direction, but not the instructive cue presented nor the spatial destination of the movement. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that a subpopulation of nucleus accumbens neurons contributes to the selection and execution of specific motivated behaviours.},

title = {Genetic triple dissociation reveals multiple roles for dopamine in reinforcement learning},
abstract = {What are the genetic and neural components that support adaptive learning from positive and negative outcomes? Here, we show with genetic analyses that three independent dopaminergic mechanisms contribute to reward and avoidance learning in humans. A polymorphism in the DARPP-32 gene, associated with striatal dopamine function, predicted relatively better probabilistic reward learning. Conversely, the C957T polymorphism of the DRD2 gene, associated with striatal D2 receptor function, predicted the degree to which participants learned to avoid choices that had been probabilistically associated with negative outcomes. The Val/Met polymorphism of the COMT gene, associated with prefrontal cortical dopamine function, predicted participants' ability to rapidly adapt behavior on a trial-to-trial basis. These findings support a neurocomputational dissociation between striatal and prefrontal dopaminergic mechanisms in reinforcement learning. Computational maximum likelihood analyses reveal independent gene effects on three reinforcement learning parameters that can explain the observed dissociations.},

title = {Statistics of midbrain dopamine neuron spike trains in the awake primate},
abstract = {Work in behaving primates indicates that midbrain dopamine neurons encode a prediction error, the difference between an obtained reward and the reward expected. Studies of dopamine action potential timing in the alert and anesthetized rat indicate that dopamine neurons respond in tonic and phasic modes, a distinction that has been less well characterized in the primates. We used spike train models to examine the relationship between the tonic and burst modes of activity in dopamine neurons while monkeys were performing a reinforced visuo-saccadic movement task. We studied spiking activity during four task-related intervals; two of these were intervals during which no task-related events occurred, whereas two were periods marked by task-related phasic activity. We found that dopamine neuron spike trains during the intervals when no events occurred were well described as tonic. Action potentials appeared to be independent, to occur at low frequency, and to be almost equally well described by Gaussian and Poisson-like (gamma) processes. Unlike in the rat, interspike intervals as low as 20 ms were often observed during these presumptively tonic epochs. Having identified these periods of presumptively tonic activity, we were able to quantitatively define phasic modulations (both increases and decreases in activity) during the intervals in which task-related events occurred. This analysis revealed that the phasic modulations of these neurons include both bursting, as has been described previously, and pausing. Together bursts and pauses seemed to provide a continuous, although nonlinear, representation of the theoretically defined reward prediction error of reinforcement learning.},

In Experiment 2, we used a Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer procedure to assess the potentiation of instrumental responding by Pavlovian conditional stimuli (CS). Although during the Pavlovian training phase the DAT KD mice entered the food magazine more frequently in the absence of the CS, when tested later both groups showed outcome-selective PIT. These results suggest that the elevated dopaminergic tone reduced the selectivity of stimulus control over conditioned behavior, but did not affect instrumental learning.},

abstract = {With the advent of event-related paradigms in functional MRI, there has been interest in finding the optimal stimulus timing, especially when the interstimulus interval is varied during the imaging run. Previous works have proposed stimulus timings to optimize either the estimation of the impulse response function (IRF) or the detection of signal changes. The purpose of this paper is to clarify that estimation and detection are fundamentally different goals and to determine the optimal stimulus timing and distribution with respect to both the accuracy of estimating the IRF and the power of detection assuming a particular hemodynamic model. Simulated stimulus distributions are varied systematically, from traditional blocked designs to rapidly varying event related designs. These simulations indicate that estimation of the hemodynamic impulse response function is optimized when stimuli are frequently alternated between task and control states, with shorter interstimulus intervals and stimulus durations, whereas the detection of activated areas is optimized by blocked designs. The stimulus timing for a given experiment should therefore be generated with the required detectability and estimation accuracy.},

title = {Role of the basal ganglia and frontal cortex in selecting and producing internally guided force pulses},
abstract = {The basal ganglia comprise a crucial circuit involved in force production and force selection, but the specific role of each nucleus to the production of force pulses and the selection of pulses of different force amplitudes remains unknown. We conducted an fMRI study in which participants produced force using a precision grip while (a) holding a steady-state force, (b) performing a series of force pulses with similar amplitude, and (c) selecting force pulses of different amplitude. Region of interest analyses were conducted in the basal ganglia and frontal cortex to compare percent signal change during force pulse versus steady-state force production and compare force amplitude selection to force production when selection of force amplitude was not present. There were three novel findings in the basal ganglia. First, the caudate nucleus increased activation during the selection of different force amplitudes when compared to producing a series of similar force pulses. Second, GPi, STN, and posterior putamen increased activation during the production of similar force amplitudes when compared to holding a steady-state force, and maintained similar activation during the production of different force amplitudes in which force selection was required. Third, GPe and anterior putamen had increased activation during the production of similar force pulses and further increased activation during the selection of different force pulses. These findings suggest that anterior basal ganglia nuclei are involved in selecting the amplitude of force contractions and posterior basal ganglia nuclei regulate basic aspects of dynamic force pulse production.},

abstract = {The Akaike information criterion (AIC; Akaike, 1973) is a popular method for comparing the adequacy of multiple, possibly nonnested models. Current practice in cognitive psychology is to accept a single model on the basis of only the "raw" AIC values, making it difficult to unambiguously interpret the observed AIC differences in terms of a continuous measure such as probability. Here we demonstrate that AIC values can be easily transformed to so-called Akaike weights (e.g., Akaike, 1978, 1979; Bozdogan, 1987; Burnham {\&} Anderson, 2002), which can be directly interpreted as conditional probabilities for each model. We show by example how these Akaike weights can greatly facilitate the interpretation of the results of AIC model comparison procedures.},

title = {Motivation modulates motor-related feedback activity in the human basal ganglia},
abstract = {It is axiomatic that motivation improves learning, a principle repeatedly stressed both in the classroom and on the sports field. Motivation's influence over learning can be considered twofold: a general arousing or energising effect, and a more goal-specific component [1]. Recent developments in reward theory suggest that the latter may be achieved through the increased weighting of 'teaching signals' computed from feedback related to the success of a given course of action, so that the respective action may be re-inforced. This view has received experimental support in the context of explicit choices between actions [2], but whether it is relevant to the trial-to-trial learning of a single action, such as a tennis return, remains unclear. We previously showed the existence of an evoked activity in the basal ganglia that correlates with accuracy of performance in a simple task and is associated with reiteration of successful motor parameters in subsequent movements [3]. Here we establish that motivation increases the amplitude of this evoked activity for a given trial accuracy, thus promoting trial-to-trial learning.},

title = {Flexible coding for categorical decisions in the human brain},
abstract = {Despite the importance of visual categorization for interpreting sensory experiences, little is known about the neural representations that mediate categorical decisions in the human brain. Here, we used psychophysics and pattern classification for the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging data to predict the features critical for categorical decisions from brain activity when observers categorized the same stimuli using different rules. Although a large network of cortical and subcortical areas contain information about visual categories, we show that only a subset of these areas shape their selectivity to reflect the behaviorally relevant features rather than simply physical similarity between stimuli. Specifically, temporal and parietal areas show selectivity for the perceived form and motion similarity, respectively. In contrast, frontal areas and the striatum represent the conjunction of spatiotemporal features critical for complex and adaptive categorization tasks and potentially modulate selectivity in temporal and parietal areas. These findings provide novel evidence for flexible neural coding in the human brain that translates sensory experiences to categorical decisions by shaping neural representations across a network of areas with dissociable functional roles in visual categorization.},

Unexpected events are more likely to be remembered than predictable events, but the under- lying neural mechanisms for these effects remain unclear. We report intracranial EEG recordings from the hippocampus of epilepsy patients, and from the nucleus accumbens of depression patients. We found that unexpected stimuli enhance an early (187 ms) and a late (482 ms) hippocampal potential, and that the late potential is associated with success- ful memory encoding for these stimuli. Recordings from the nucleus accumbens revealed a late potential (peak at 475 ms), which increases in magnitude during unexpected items, but no subsequent memory effect and no early component. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that activity in a loop involving the hippocampus and the nucleus accum- bens promotes encoding of unexpected events.},

abstract = {This article reviews and interprets neuronal activities related to the expectation and delivery of reward in the primate orbitofrontal cortex, in comparison with slowly discharging neurons in the striatum (caudate, putamen and ventral striatum, including nucleus accumbens) and midbrain dopamine neurons. Orbitofrontal neurons showed three principal forms of reward-related activity during the performance of delayed response tasks, namely responses to reward-predicting instructions, activations during the expectation period immediately preceding reward and responses following reward. These activations discriminated between different rewards, often on the basis of the animals' preferences. Neurons in the striatum were also activated in relation to the expectation and detection of reward but in addition showed activities related to the preparation, initiation and execution of movements which reflected the expected reward. Dopamine neurons responded to rewards and reward-predicting stimuli, and coded an error in the prediction of reward. Thus, the investigated cortical and basal ganglia structures showed multiple, heterogeneous, partly simultaneous activations which were related to specific aspects of rewards. These activations may represent the neuronal substrates of rewards during learning and established behavioral performance. The processing of reward expectations suggests an access to central representations of rewards which may be used for the neuronal control of goaldirected behavior.},

title = {Modeling the violation of reward maximization and invariance in reinforcement schedules},
abstract = {It is often assumed that animals and people adjust their behavior to maximize reward acquisition. In visually cued reinforcement schedules, monkeys make errors in trials that are not immediately rewarded, despite having to repeat error trials. Here we show that error rates are typically smaller in trials equally distant from reward but belonging to longer schedules (referred to as "schedule length effect"). This violates the principles of reward maximization and invariance and cannot be predicted by the standard methods of Reinforcement Learning, such as the method of temporal differences. We develop a heuristic model that accounts for all of the properties of the behavior in the reinforcement schedule task but whose predictions are not different from those of the standard temporal difference model in choice tasks. In the modification of temporal difference learning introduced here, the effect of schedule length emerges spontaneously from the sensitivity to the immediately preceding trial. We also introduce a policy for general Markov Decision Processes, where the decision made at each node is conditioned on the motivation to perform an instrumental action, and show that the application of our model to the reinforcement schedule task and the choice task are special cases of this general theoretical framework. Within this framework, Reinforcement Learning can approach contextual learning with the mixture of empirical findings and principled assumptions that seem to coexist in the best descriptions of animal behavior. As examples, we discuss two phenomena observed in humans that often derive from the violation of the principle of invariance: "framing," wherein equivalent options are treated differently depending on the context in which they are presented, and the "sunk cost" effect, the greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment in money, effort, or time has been made. The schedule length effect might be a manifestation of these phenomena in monkeys.},

abstract = {Reward from a particular action is seldom immediate, and the influence of such delayed outcome on choice decreases with delay. It has been postulated that when faced with immediate and delayed rewards, decision makers choose the option with maximum temporally discounted value. We examined the preference of monkeys for delayed reward in an intertemporal choice task and the neural basis for real-time computation of temporally discounted values in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. During this task, the locations of the targets associated with small or large rewards and their corresponding delays were randomly varied. We found that prefrontal neurons often encoded the temporally discounted value of reward expected from a particular option. Furthermore, activity tended to increase when discounted values for targets were presented in the neuron's preferred direction, suggesting that activity related to temporally discounted values in the prefrontal cortex might determine the animal's behavior during intertemporal choice.},

To test hypothesis, we assessed cognitive sequence learning in 120 healthy volunteers and measured plasma levels of homovanillic acid [HVA] (a metabolite of dopamine), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid [5-HIAA] (a metabolite of serotonin), and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxypheylglycol [MHPG] (a metabolite of norepinephrine). Results revealed a significant negative relationship between errors in the feedback-guided training phase of the sequence learning task and the plasma HVA level. The HVA level accounted for 10.5% of variance of performance. Participant who had lower HVA level than the median value of the whole sample committed more errors during the training phase compared with participants who had higher HVA plasma level than the median value. A similar phenomenon was not observed for the context-dependent phase of the task and for 5-HIAA and MHPG. These results suggest that dopamine plays a special role in feedback-guided cognitive sequence learning.},

title = {Cortico-striatal contributions to feedback-based learning: converging data from neuroimaging and neuropsychology},
abstract = {The striatum has been widely implicated in cognition, but a precise understanding of its role remains elusive. Here we present converging evidence for the role of the striatum in feedback-based learning. In a prior functional imaging study, healthy controls showed striatal activity during a feedback-based learning task, which was decreased when the same task was learned without feedback. In the present study, we show that individuals with striatal dysfunction due to Parkinson's disease are impaired on the feedback-based task, but not on a non-feedback version of the same task. Parkinson's patients and controls also used different learning strategies depending on feedback structure. This study provides direct behavioural evidence from humans that cortico-striatal systems are necessary for feedback-based learning on a cognitive task. These findings also link between learning impairments in Parkinson's disease and the physiological and computational evidence for the role of midbrain dopaminergic systems in feedback processing.},

title = {Adaptation to Synaptic Inactivity in Hippocampal Neurons},
abstract = {Summary In response to activity deprivation, CNS neurons undergo slow adaptive modification of unitary synaptic transmission. The changes are comparable in degree to those induced by brief intense stimulation, but their molecular basis is largely unknown. Our data indicate that prolonged AMPAR blockade acts through loss of Ca2+ entry through L-type Ca2+ channels to bring about an increase in both vesicle pool size and turnover rate, as well as a postsynaptic enhancement of the contribution of GluR1 homomers, concentrated at the largest synapses. The changes were consistent with a morphological scaling of overall synapse size, but also featured a dramatic shift toward synaptic drive contributed by the Ca2+-permeable homomeric GluR1 receptors. These results extend beyond \tt"synaptic homeostasis\tt" to involve more profound changes that can be better described as \tt"metaplasticity.\tt"},

title = {Why don't we move faster? Parkinson's disease, movement vigor, and implicit motivation},
abstract = {People generally select a similar speed for a given motor task, such as reaching for a cup. One well established determinant of movement time is the speed-accuracy trade-off: movement time increases with the accuracy requirement. A second possible determinant is the energetic cost of making a movement. Parkinson's disease (PD), a condition characterized by generalized movement slowing (bradykinesia), provides the opportunity to directly explore this second possibility. We compared reaching movements of patients with PD with those of control subjects in a speed-accuracy trade-off task comprising conditions of increasing difficulty. Subjects completed as many trials as necessary to make 20 movements within a required speed range (trials to criterion, N(c)). Difficulty was reflected in endpoint accuracy and N(c). Patients were as accurate as control subjects in all conditions (i.e., PD did not affect the speed-accuracy trade-off). However, N(c) was consistently higher in patients, indicating reluctance to move fast although accuracy was not compromised. Specifically, the dependence of N(c) on movement energy cost (slope S(N)) was steeper in patients than in control subjects. This difference in S(N) suggests that bradykinesia represents an implicit decision not to move fast because of a shift in the cost/benefit ratio of the energy expenditure needed to move at normal speed. S(N) was less steep, but statistically significant, in control subjects, which demonstrates a role for energetic cost in the normal control of movement speed. We propose that, analogous to the established role of dopamine in explicit reward-seeking behavior, the dopaminergic projection to the striatum provides a signal for implicit "motor motivation."},

abstract = {Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) neurons encode rewards and the cues that predict them, providing a neural substrate for outcome expectancy, an important component of goal-directed behavior in animals and humans. Here, we recorded and analyzed single units from rat lateral OFC during performance of a task in which the encoding of an expected rewarding outcome could be isolated from the response made in obtaining it. We found concurrent encoding of the expected outcome and the behavioral response in mostly separate populations of OFC units, in each phase of task performance: odor sampling, behavioral response, and waiting during the delay before reward delivery. Population analyses showed that outcome encoding broadly spanned across each behavioral phase, whereas response-selective firings were time-locked to the behavioral events, especially the completion of the behavioral response. A significant subset of outcome-selective units maintained selective firings from either odor sampling or response initiation until reward delivery. In contrast, response-selective units typically showed transient activation time locked to the behavioral events and were less likely to maintain selective firings across behavioral phases than outcome-selective units. These data demonstrate a broader role of OFC information processing in goal-directed behavior, beyond its widely recognized role in outcome expectancy.},

abstract = {Memory is essential to adaptive behavior because it allows past experience to guide choices. Emerging findings indicate that the neurotransmitter dopamine, which signals motivationally important events, also modulates the hippocampus, a crucial brain system for long-term memory. Here we review recent evidence that highlights multiple mechanisms whereby dopamine biases memory towards events that are of motivational significance. These effects take place over a variety of timescales, permitting both expectations and outcomes to influence memory. Thus, dopamine ensures that memories are relevant and accessible for future adaptive behavior, a concept we refer to as 'adaptive memory'. Understanding adaptive memory at biological and psychological levels helps to resolve a fundamental challenge in memory research: explaining what is remembered, and why.},

NAcc activation correlated with both valence and salience. On trials with certain outcomes, NAcc activation increased for anticipated gains and decreased for anticipated losses. On trials with uncertain outcomes, NAcc activation increased for both anticipated gains and losses but did not differ between them. These findings suggest that NAcc activation separately represents both valence and salience, consistent with its hypothesized role in appetitive motivation.},

abstract = {Optimal behavior in a competitive world requires the flexibility to adapt decision strategies based on recent outcomes. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that this flexibility emerges through a reinforcement learning process, in which reward prediction errors are used dynamically to adjust representations of decision options. We recorded event-related brain potentials (ERPs) while subjects played a strategic economic game against a computer opponent to evaluate how neural responses to outcomes related to subsequent decision-making. Analyses of ERP data focused on the feedback-related negativity (FRN), an outcome-locked potential thought to reflect a neural prediction error signal. Consistent with predictions of a computational reinforcement learning model, we found that the magnitude of ERPs after losing to the computer opponent predicted whether subjects would change decision behavior on the subsequent trial. Furthermore, FRNs to decision outcomes were disproportionately larger over the motor cortex contralateral to the response hand that was used to make the decision. These findings provide novel evidence that humans engage a reinforcement learning process to adjust representations of competing decision options.},

These findings reveal a mechanism by which frontal and basal ganglia activity exerts attentional control over access to working memory storage in the parietal cortex in humans, and makes an important contribution to inter-individual differences in working memory capacity.},

title = {Acquired equivalence changes stimulus representations},
abstract = {Acquired equivalence is a paradigm in which generalization is increased between two superficially dissimilar stimuli (or antecedents) that have previously been associated with similar outcomes (or consequents). Several possible mechanisms have been proposed, including changes in stimulus representations, either in the form of added associations or a change of feature salience. A different way of conceptualizing acquired equivalence is in terms of strategic inference: Confronted with a choice on which it has no evidence, the organism may infer from its history of reinforcement what the best option is, and that inference is observed as acquired equivalence. To test this account, we combined an incremental learning task with an episodic memory test. Drawings of faces were made equivalent through acquired equivalence training, and then paired with words in a list learning paradigm. When participants were asked to recognize specific face-word pairings, they confused faces more often when they had been made equivalent. This suggests that prior acquired equivalence training does influence how memories are coded. We also tested whether this change in coding reflected acquisition of new associations, as suggested by the associative mediation account, or whether stimuli become more similar through a reweighting of stimulus features, as assumed by some categorization theories. Results supported the associative mediation view. We discuss similarities between this view and exemplar theories of categorization performance.},

title = {Threshold-free cluster enhancement: addressing problems of smoothing, threshold dependence and localisation in cluster inference},
abstract = {Many image enhancement and thresholding techniques make use of spatial neighbourhood information to boost belief in extended areas of signal. The most common such approach in neuroimaging is cluster-based thresholding, which is often more sensitive than voxel-wise thresholding. However, a limitation is the need to define the initial cluster-forming threshold. This threshold is arbitrary, and yet its exact choice can have a large impact on the results, particularly at the lower (e.g., t, z < 4) cluster-forming thresholds frequently used. Furthermore, the amount of spatial pre-smoothing is also arbitrary (given that the expected signal extent is very rarely known in advance of the analysis). In the light of such problems, we propose a new method which attempts to keep the sensitivity benefits of cluster-based thresholding (and indeed the general concept of "clusters" of signal), while avoiding (or at least minimising) these problems. The method takes a raw statistic image and produces an output image in which the voxel-wise values represent the amount of cluster-like local spatial support. The method is thus referred to as "threshold-free cluster enhancement" (TFCE). We present the TFCE approach and discuss in detail ROC-based optimisation and comparisons with cluster-based and voxel-based thresholding. We find that TFCE gives generally better sensitivity than other methods over a wide range of test signal shapes and SNR values. We also show an example on a real imaging dataset, suggesting that TFCE does indeed provide not just improved sensitivity, but richer and more interpretable output than cluster-based thresholding.},

Bioperl provides an easy-to-use, stable, and consistent programming interface for bioinformatics application programmers. The Bioperl modules have been successfully and repeatedly used to reduce otherwise complex tasks to only a few lines of code. The Bioperl object model has been proven to be flexible enough to support enterprise-level applications such as EnsEMBL, while maintaining an easy learning curve for novice Perl programmers. Bioperl is capable of executing analyses and processing results from programs such as BLAST, ClustalW, or the EMBOSS suite. Interoperation with modules written in Python and Java is supported through the evolving BioCORBA bridge. Bioperl provides access to data stores such as GenBank and SwissProt via a flexible series of sequence input/output modules, and to the emerging common sequence data storage format of the Open Bioinformatics Database Access project. This study describes the overall architecture of the toolkit, the problem domains that it addresses, and gives specific examples of how the toolkit can be used to solve common life-sciences problems. We conclude with a discussion of how the open-source nature of the project has contributed to the development effort.{\$}[{\$}Supplemental material is available online at www.genome.org.

abstract = {In neural integrators, transient inputs are accumulated into persistent firing rates that are a neural correlate of short-term memory. Integrators often contain two opposing cell populations that increase and decrease sustained firing as a stored parameter value rises. A leading hypothesis for the mechanism of persistence is positive feedback through mutual inhibition between these opposing populations. We tested predictions of this hypothesis in the goldfish oculomotor velocity-to-position integrator by measuring the eye position and firing rates of one population, while pharmacologically silencing the opposing one. In complementary experiments, we measured responses in a partially silenced single population. Contrary to predictions, induced drifts in neural firing were limited to half of the oculomotor range. We built network models with synaptic-input thresholds to demonstrate a new hypothesis suggested by these data: mutual inhibition between the populations does not provide positive feedback in support of integration, but rather coordinates persistent activity intrinsic to each population.},

abstract = {High-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (hi-res fMRI) promises to help bridge the gap between the macro- and the microview of brain function afforded by conventional neuroimaging and invasive cell recording, respectively. Hi-res fMRI (voxel volume<or=(2 mm)3 is robustly achievable in human studies today using widely available clinical 3-Tesla scanners. However, the neuroscientific exploitation of the greater spatial detail poses four challenges: (1) Hi-res fMRI may give inaccurate (i.e. blurred, displaced and distorted) images of fine-scale neuronal activity patterns. (2) Single small voxels yield very noisy measurements. (3) The greater number of voxels complicates interpretation and poses a more severe multiple-comparisons problem. (4) The functional correspondency mapping between individual brains is unknown at the fine scale of millimeters. Here we argue that these challenges can be met by shifting the focus of brain mapping and visualizing, not the activity patterns themselves, but the amount of information they convey about the experimental conditions.},

title = {Cooperation between the Hippocampus and the Striatum during Episodic Encoding},
abstract = {The hippocampus and the striatum are thought to play distinct roles in learning and memory, each supporting an independent memory system. A fundamental question is whether, and how, these systems interact to jointly contribute to learning and memory. In particular, it remains unknown whether the striatum contributes selectively to implicit, habitual learning, or whether the striatum may also contribute to long-term episodic memory. Here, we show with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) that the hippocampus and the striatum interact cooperatively to support episodic memory formation. Participants were scanned during a memory encoding paradigm and, subsequently, were tested for memory of encoded items. fMRI data revealed that successful memory was associated with greater activity in both the hippocampus and the striatum (putamen) during encoding. Furthermore, activity in the hippocampus and the striatum was correlated within subjects for items that were later remembered, but not for items that were forgotten. Finally, across subjects, the strength of the correlation between the hippocampus and the striatum predicted memory success. These findings provide novel evidence for contributions of both the striatum and the hippocampus to successful episodic encoding and for a cooperative interaction between them.},

title = {Spatial representation of overlearned arbitrary visuomotor associations},
abstract = {Our movements can be guided directly by spatial information, but also more flexibly through arbitrary rules. We have recently shown that as arbitrary visuomotor mappings became overlearned, they come to rely not only on fronto-striatal circuits, but also on the posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Since this region supports multiple reference frames for hand movements, the question arose whether overlearned visuomotor associations could come to rely on a spatial framework, similar to spatially guided movements. Alternatively, overlearned visuomotor associations could be non-spatial in nature. In this study we investigate the characteristics of the movement representations supporting arbitrary visuomotor mappings by assessing how performance of extensively trained arbitrary visuomotor associations depends on the effector used to provide the response. After extensive training on a set of arbitrary visuomotor associations, subjects were asked to perform the same task in one of two novel settings that varied either the spatial or the motor relationship between visual instructions and finger movements. We found that the change in spatial configuration resulted in a larger amount of interference on the performance of the original mappings than the configuration change in motor coordinates. This result suggests that the visual stimuli became arbitrarily coupled to locations in space and not directly to the finger movements. We infer that overlearned arbitrary visuomotor associations are represented in spatial coordinates, in an effector-independent framework. This result raises the possibility that the previously reported involvement of the posterior parietal cortex in overlearned visuomotor behavior reflects the transition from an arbitrary visuomotor mapping into a spatially based stimulus-location-response mapping.},

However, the neuronal basis of such reward probability distortions and their position in the decision process are largely unknown. We assessed individual probability distortions with behavioral pleasantness ratings and brain imaging in the absence of choice. Dorsolateral frontal cortex regions showed experience dependent overweighting of small, and underweighting of large, probabilities whereas ventral frontal regions showed the opposite pattern. These results demonstrate distorted neuronal coding of reward probabilities in the absence of choice, stress the importance of experience with probabilistic outcomes and contrast with linear probability coding in the striatum. Input of the distorted probability estimations to decision-making mechanisms are likely to contribute to well known inconsistencies in preferences formalized in theories of behavioral economics.},

title = {Negative BOLD fMRI response in the visual cortex carries precise stimulus-specific information},
abstract = {Sustained positive BOLD (blood oxygen level-dependent) activity is employed extensively in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies as evidence for task or stimulus-specific neural responses. However, the presence of sustained negative BOLD activity (i.e., sustained responses that are lower than the fixation baseline) has remained more difficult to interpret. Some studies suggest that it results from local "blood stealing" wherein blood is diverted to neurally active regions without a concomitant change of neural activity in the negative BOLD regions. However, other evidence suggests that negative BOLD is a result of local neural suppression. In both cases, regions of negative BOLD response are usually interpreted as carrying relatively little, if any, stimulus-specific information (hence the predominant reliance on positive BOLD activity in fMRI). Here we show that the negative BOLD response resulting from visual stimulation can carry high information content that is stimulus-specific. Using a general linear model (GLM), we contrasted standard flickering stimuli to a fixation baseline and found regions of the visual cortex that displayed a sustained negative BOLD response, consistent with several previous studies. Within these negative BOLD regions, we compared patterns of fMRI activity generated by flickering Gabors that were systematically shifted in position. As the Gabors were shifted further from each other, the correlation in the spatial pattern of activity across a population of voxels (such as the population of V1 voxels that displayed a negative BOLD response) decreased significantly. Despite the fact that the BOLD signal was significantly negative (lower than fixation baseline), these regions were able to discriminate objects separated by less than 0.5 deg (at approximately 10 deg eccentricity). The results suggest that meaningful, stimulus-specific processing occurs even in regions that display a strong negative BOLD response.},

abstract = {Central serotonin (5-HT) has been implicated in emotional and behavioral control processes for many decades, but its precise contribution is not well understood. We used the acute tryptophan depletion procedure in young healthy volunteers to test the hypothesis that central 5-HT is critical for predicting punishment. An observational reversal-learning task was employed that provided separate measures of punishment and reward prediction. Under baseline, subjects made more prediction errors for punishment-associated stimuli than for reward-associated stimuli. This bias was abolished after central 5-HT depletion, which enhanced the ability to predict punishment while not affecting reward prediction. The selective potentiation of punishment prediction concurs with recent theorizing, suggesting that central 5-HT carries a prediction error for future punishment, but not for future reward (Daw et al, 2002). Furthermore, the finding highlights the importance of central 5-HT in resilience to adversity and may have implications for a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including depression and anxiety.},

title = {Temporal sequence learning, prediction, and control: a review of different models and their relation to biological mechanisms},
abstract = {In this review, we compare methods for temporal sequence learning (TSL) across the disciplines machine-control, classical conditioning, neuronal models for TSL as well as spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). This review introduces the most influential models and focuses on two questions: To what degree are reward-based (e.g., TD learning) and correlation-based (Hebbian) learning related? and How do the different models correspond to possibly underlying biological mechanisms of synaptic plasticity? We first compare the different models in an open-loop condition, where behavioral feedback does not alter the learning. Here we observe that reward-based and correlation-based learning are indeed very similar. Machine control is then used to introduce the problem of closed-loop control (e.g., actor-critic architectures). Here the problem of evaluative (rewards) versus nonevaluative (correlations) feedback from the environment will be discussed, showing that both learning approaches are fundamentally different in the closed-loop condition. In trying to answer the second question, we compare neuronal versions of the different learning architectures to the anatomy of the involved brain structures (basal-ganglia, thalamus, and cortex) and the molecular biophysics of glutamatergic and dopaminergic synapses. Finally, we discuss the different algorithms used to model STDP and compare them to reward-based learning rules. Certain similarities are found in spite of the strongly different timescales. Here we focus on the biophysics of the different calcium-release mechanisms known to be involved in STDP.},

The PREDICTION CONTROL problem
learn to predict an event
and learn to preform an anticapatory action.

Control also can select among policies (or scalar values) to further optimize reward acquisition.  This is somehow realted to action selection (in the text)

MDP: finite, can be visited, states are informative

Well said:
The goal of RL is to maximize the expected cumulative reward (the ``re- 
turn'') by subsequently visiting a subset of states in the MDP

title = {Modulation of competing memory systems by distraction},
abstract = {Different forms of learning and memory depend on functionally and anatomically separable neural circuits [Squire, L. R. (1992) Psychol. Rev. 99, 195-231]. Declarative memory relies on a medial temporal lobe system, whereas habit learning relies on the striatum [Cohen, N. J. {\&} Eichenbaum, H. (1993) Memory, Amnesia, and the Hippocampal System (MIT Press, Cambridge, MA)]. How these systems are engaged to optimize learning and behavior is not clear. Here, we present results from functional neuroimaging showing that the presence of a demanding secondary task during learning modulates the degree to which subjects solve a problem using either declarative memory or habit learning. Dual-task conditions did not reduce accuracy but reduced the amount of declarative learning about the task. Medial temporal lobe activity was correlated with task performance and declarative knowledge after learning under single-task conditions, whereas performance was correlated with striatal activity after dual-task learning conditions. These results demonstrate a fundamental difference in these memory systems in their sensitivity to concurrent distraction. The results are consistent with the notion that declarative and habit learning compete to mediate task performance, and they suggest that the presence of distraction can bias this competition. These results have implications for learning in multitask situations, suggesting that, even if distraction does not decrease the overall level of learning, it can result in the acquisition of knowledge that can be applied less flexibly in new situations.},

abstract = {The mesial premotor cortex (pre-supplementary motor area and supplementary motor area proper), lateral premotor cortex (dorsal premotor cortex and ventral premotor cortex), and primary sensorimotor cortex (primary motor cortex and primary somatosensory cortex) have been identified as key cortical areas for sensorimotor function. However, the three-dimensional (3-D) anatomic boundaries between these regions remain unclear. In order to clarify the locations and boundaries for these six sensorimotor regions, we surveyed 126 articles describing pre-supplementary motor area, supplementary motor area proper, dorsal premotor cortex, ventral premotor cortex, primary motor cortex, and primary somatosensory cortex. Using strict inclusion criteria, we recorded the reported normalized stereotaxic coordinates (Talairach and Tournoux or MNI) from each experiment. We then computed the probability distributions describing the likelihood of activation, and characterized the shape, extent, and area of each sensorimotor region in 3-D. Additionally, we evaluated the nature of the overlap between the six sensorimotor regions. Using the findings from this meta-analysis, along with suggestions and guidelines of previous researchers, we developed the Human Motor Area Template (HMAT) that can be used for ROI analysis. HMAT is available through e-mail from the corresponding author.},

The complexity of the data creates a need for statistical summary, but the local averaging standardly applied to this end may obscure the effects of greatest neuroscientific interest. In neuroimaging, for example, brain mapping analysis has focused on the discovery of activation, i.e., of extended brain regions whose average activity changes across experimental conditions. Here we propose to ask a more general question of the data: Where in the brain does the activity pattern contain information about the experimental condition? To address this question, we propose scanning the imaged volume with a "searchlight," whose contents are analyzed multivariately at each location in the brain.},

abstract = {We reported previously that as monkeys used abstract response strategies to choose spatial goals, 1 population of prefrontal cortex neurons encoded future goals (F cells), whereas a largely separate population encoded previous goals (P cells). Here, to better understand the mechanisms of goal selection and maintenance, we studied correlated activity among pairs of these neurons. Among the 3 possible types of pairs, F-F and F-P pairs often exhibited significant correlations when and after monkeys selected future goals but P-P pairs rarely did. These correlations were stronger when monkeys shifted from a previous goal than when they stayed with that goal. In addition, members of F-F pairs usually preferred the same goal and thus shared both prospective coding and spatial tuning properties. In contrast, cells composing F-P pairs usually had different spatial preferences and thus shared neither coding nor spatial tuning properties. On the assumption that the neurons composing a pair send convergent outputs to target neurons, their correlated activity could enhance their efficacy in context-dependent goal selection, goal maintenance, and the transformation of goal choices into action.},

title = {Top-Down Attentional Control in Parkinson's Disease: Salient Considerations},
abstract = {Abstract Cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) has been hypothesized to reflect a failure of cortical control. In keeping with this hypothesis, some of the cognitive deficits in PD resemble those seen in patients with lesions in the lateral pFC, which has been associated with top-down attentional control. However, there is no direct evidence for a failure of top-down control mechanisms in PD. Here we fill this gap by demonstrating disproportionate control by bottom-up attention to dimensional salience during attentional set shifting. Patients needed significantly more trials to criterion than did controls when shifting to a low-salient dimension while, remarkably, needing significantly fewer trials to criterion than did controls when shifting to a high-salient dimension. Thus, attention was captured by bottom-up attention to salient information to a greater extent in patients than in controls. The results provide a striking reinterpretation of prior set-shifting data and provide the first direct evidence for a failure of top-down attentional control, resembling that seen after catecholamine depletion in the pFC.},

title = {Inactivation of dorsolateral striatum enhances sensitivity to changes in the action-outcome contingency in instrumental conditioning},
abstract = {Actions become compulsive when they are no longer controlled by their consequences. Compulsivity can be assessed using the omission procedure in which animals are required to withhold a previously reinforced action to earn reward. The current study tested the hypothesis that inactivation of the dorsolateral striatum (DLS), a structure implicated in habitual behavior, can enhance sensitivity to changes in the action-outcome contingency during omission training, thus leading to a reduction in compulsive responding. Over 10 days rats were trained to press a freely available lever for sucrose reward delivered on interval schedules of reinforcement. After learning to press the lever at a stable and high rate, rats in the omission group received a session in which the rewards were now delayed by pressing the lever; i.e. withholding lever pressing resulted in increased access to reward. A control group was yoked to the omission group and received the same number and pattern of reward delivery but without the omission contingency. Half the rats in each group received infusions of vehicle into the DLS prior to this training whereas the remainder received an infusion of the GABA-A receptor agonist muscimol. On the next day, the effect of these treatments was assessed on a probe test in which the tendency of the various groups to press the lever was assessed in extinction and without drug infusion. Rats that received vehicle infusions prior to the omission session showed complete insensitivity to the newly imposed omission contingency. In contrast, rats given the infusion of muscimol selectively reduced lever pressing compared to yoked controls. Thus, extended training with interval schedules resulted in compulsive lever pressing that prevented the learning of the omission contingency, whereas inactivation of the DLS appeared to enhance the rats' sensitivity to this change in the action-outcome contingency.},

Previously, we had found that the striatum showed a pattern of sustained activation after presentation of a monetary reward, in contrast to a decrease in the hemodynamic response after a punishment. In this study, we tested whether the activity of the striatum could be modulated by parametric variations in the amount of financial reward or punishment. We used an event-related fMRI design in which participants received large or small monetary rewards or punishments after performance in a gambling task. A parametric ordering of conditions was observed in the dorsal striatum according to both magnitude and valence. In addition, an early response to the presentation of feedback was observed and replicated in a second experiment with increased temporal resolution. This study further implicates the dorsal striatum as an integral component of a reward circuitry responsible for the control of motivated behavior, serving to code for such feedback properties as valence and magnitude.},

abstract = {Traditional inference in neuroimaging consists in describing brain activations elicited and modulated by different kinds of stimuli. Recently, however, paradigms have been studied in which the converse operation is performed, thus inferring behavioral or mental states associated with activation images. Here, we use the well-known retinotopy of the visual cortex to infer the visual content of real or imaginary scenes from the brain activation patterns that they elicit. We present two decoding algorithms: an explicit technique, based on the current knowledge of the retinotopic structure of the visual areas, and an implicit technique, based on supervised classifiers. Both algorithms predicted the stimulus identity with significant accuracy. Furthermore, we extend this principle to mental imagery data: in five data sets, our algorithms could reconstruct and predict with significant accuracy a pattern imagined by the subjects.},

title = {The role of immediate and final goals in action planning: an fMRI study},
abstract = {To interact effectively with our environment, we need to specify the intended outcomes (goals) of our actions. In this process, immediate goals and final goals can be regarded as different levels within a hierarchically organized system for action planning: immediate goals and movement details are selected to accomplish more remote goals. Behavioral studies support this notion of different levels of action planning, but the neurophysiological basis remains unclear. Using fMRI, we examined the neural correlates of preparing object manipulations based on either the desired end-state (the final goal) or the initial movement towards a target (the immediate goal). Subjects had to insert an object (consisting of a large and a small cube) into one of two corresponding large and small slots. The subjects were cued on either which slot to fill (Final Goal trials) or which object part to grasp (Immediate Goal trials). These actions required similar movements, but different planning. During Final Goal trials, there was differential preparatory activity along the superior frontal gyrus (bilaterally) and in left inferior parietal cortex. Immediate Goal trials evoked differential activity in occipito-parietal and occipito-temporal cortex. These findings support the notion that actions can be planned at different levels. We show that different fronto-parietal circuits plan the same action, by a relative emphasis on either selecting a sequence of movements to achieve a desired end-state, or selecting movements spatially compatible with given object properties.},

title = {Striatal dopamine predicts outcome-specific reversal learning and its sensitivity to dopaminergic drug administration},
abstract = {Individual variability in reward-based learning has been ascribed to quantitative variation in baseline levels of striatal dopamine. However, direct evidence for this pervasive hypothesis has hitherto been unavailable. We demonstrate that individual differences in reward-based reversal learning reflect variation in baseline striatal dopamine synthesis capacity, as measured with neurochemical positron emission tomography. Subjects with high baseline dopamine synthesis in the striatum showed relatively better reversal learning from unexpected rewards than from unexpected punishments, whereas subjects with low baseline dopamine synthesis in the striatum showed the reverse pattern. In addition, baseline dopamine synthesis predicted the direction of dopaminergic drug effects. The D(2) receptor agonist bromocriptine improved reward-based relative to punishment-based reversal learning in subjects with low baseline dopamine synthesis capacity, while impairing it in subjects with high baseline dopamine synthesis capacity in the striatum. Finally, this pattern of drug effects was outcome-specific, and driven primarily by drug effects on punishment-, but not reward-based reversal learning. These data demonstrate that the effects of D(2) receptor stimulation on reversal learning in humans depend on task demands and baseline striatal dopamine synthesis capacity.},

abstract = {Psychologists have linked the personality trait extraversion both to differences in reward sensitivity and to dopamine functioning, but little is known about how these differences are reflected in the functioning of the brain's dopaminergic neural reward system. Here, we show that individual differences in extraversion and the presence of the A1 allele on the dopamine D2 receptor gene predict activation magnitudes in the brain's reward system during a gambling task. In two functional MRI experiments, participants probabilistically received rewards either immediately following a behavioral response (Study 1) or after a 7.5 s anticipation period (Study 2). Although group activation maps revealed anticipation- and reward-related activations in the reward system, individual differences in extraversion and the presence of the D2 Taq1A allele predicted a significant amount of inter-subject variability in the magnitudes of reward-related, but not anticipation-related, activations. These results demonstrate a link between stable differences in personality, genetics, and brain functioning.},

In the memory field, the view that there are independent implicit and explicit memory systems has been predominantly supported by dissociation evidence. Here, we argue that many of these dissociations do not necessarily imply distinct memory systems. We review recent work with a single-system computational model that extends signal-detection theory (SDT) to implicit memory. SDT has had a major influence on research in a variety of domains. The current work shows that it can be broadened even further in its range of application. Indeed, the single-system model that we present does surprisingly well in accounting for some key dissociations that have been taken as evidence for independent implicit and explicit memory systems.},

title = {Human striatal activation reflects degree of stimulus saliency},
abstract = {Salient stimuli are characterized by their capability to perturb and seize available cognitive resources. Although the striatum and its dopaminergic inputs respond to a variety of stimuli categorically defined as salient, including rewards, the relationship between striatal activity and saliency is not well understood. Specifically, it is unclear if the striatum responds in an all-or-none fashion to salient events or instead responds in a graded fashion to the degree of saliency associated with an event. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we measured activity in the brains of 20 participants performing a visual classification task in which they identified single digits as odd or even numbers. An auditory tone preceded each number, which was occasionally, and unexpectedly, substituted by a novel sound. The novel sounds varied in their ability to interrupt and reallocate cognitive resources (i.e., their saliency) as measured by a delay in reaction time to immediately subsequent numerical task-stimuli. The present findings demonstrate that striatal activity increases proportionally to the degree to which an unexpected novel sound interferes with the current cognitive focus, even in the absence of reward. These results suggest that activity in the human striatum reflects the level of saliency associated with a stimulus, perhaps providing a signal to reallocate limited resources to important events.},

abstract = {Midbrain dopaminergic neurons (DANs) typically increase their discharge rate in response to appetitive predictive cues and outcomes, whereas striatal cholinergic tonically active interneurons (TANs) decrease their rate. This may indicate that the activity of TANs and DANs is negatively correlated and that TANs can broaden the basal ganglia reinforcement teaching signal, for instance by encoding worse than predicted events. We studied the activity of 106 DANs and 180 TANs of two monkeys recorded during the performance of a classical conditioning task with cues predicting the probability of food, neutral, and air puff outcomes. DANs responded to all cues with elevations of discharge rate, whereas TANs depressed their discharge rate. Nevertheless, although dopaminergic responses to appetitive cues were larger than their responses to neutral or aversive cues, the TAN responses were more similar. Both TANs and DANs responded faster to an air puff than to a food outcome; however, DANs responded with a discharge elevation, whereas the TAN responses included major negative and positive deflections. Finally, food versus air puff omission was better encoded by TANs. In terms of the activity of single neurons with distinct responses to the different behavioral events, both DANs and TANs were more strongly modulated by reward than by aversive related events and better reflected the probability of reward than aversive outcome. Thus, TANs and DANs encode the task episodes differentially. The DANs encode mainly the cue and outcome delivery, whereas the TANs mainly encode outcome delivery and omission at termination of the behavioral trial episode.},

title = {Distinct Hippocampal and Basal Ganglia Contributions to Probabilistic Learning and Reversal},
abstract = {Abstract The hippocampus and the basal ganglia are thought to play fundamental and distinct roles in learning and memory, supporting two dissociable memory systems. Interestingly, however, the hippocampus and the basal ganglia have each, separately, been implicated as necessary for reversal learning-the ability to adaptively change a response when previously learned stimulus-outcome contingencies are reversed. Here, we compared the contribution of the hippocampus and the basal ganglia to distinct aspects of learning and reversal. Amnesic subjects with selective hippocampal damage, Parkinson's subjects with disrupted basal ganglia function, and healthy controls were tested on a novel probabilistic learning and reversal paradigm. In this task, reversal can be achieved in two ways: Subjects can reverse a previously learned response, or, they can select a new cue during the reversal phase, effectively "opting out" of the reversal. We found that both patient groups were intact at initial learning, but differed in their ability to reverse. Amnesic subjects failed to reverse, and continued to use the same cue and response learned before the reversal. Parkinson's subjects, by contrast, opted out of the reversal by learning a new cue-outcome association. These results suggest that both the hippocampus and the basal ganglia support reversal learning, but in different ways. The basal ganglia are necessary for learning a new response when a previously learned response is no longer rewarding. The failure of the amnesic subjects to reverse their response or to learn a new cue is consistent with a more general role for the hippocampus in configural learning, and suggests it may also support the ability to respond to changes in cue-outcome contingencies.},

abstract = {The loss of striatal dopamine (DA) in Parkinson's disease (PD) models triggers a cell-type-specific reduction in the density of dendritic spines in D(2) receptor-expressing striatopallidal medium spiny neurons (D(2) MSNs). How the intrinsic properties of MSN dendrites, where the vast majority of DA receptors are found, contribute to this adaptation is not clear. To address this question, two-photon laser scanning microscopy (2PLSM) was performed in patch-clamped mouse MSNs identified in striatal slices by expression of green fluorescent protein (eGFP) controlled by DA receptor promoters. These studies revealed that single backpropagating action potentials (bAPs) produced more reliable elevations in cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration at distal dendritic locations in D(2) MSNs than at similar locations in D(1) receptor-expressing striatonigral MSNs (D(1) MSNs). In both cell types, the dendritic Ca(2+) entry elicited by bAPs was enhanced by pharmacological blockade of Kv4, but not Kv1 K(+) channels. Local application of DA depressed dendritic bAP-evoked Ca(2+) transients, whereas application of ACh increased these Ca(2+) transients in D(2) MSNs, but not in D(1) MSNs. After DA depletion, bAP-evoked Ca(2+) transients were enhanced in distal dendrites and spines in D(2) MSNs. Together, these results suggest that normally D(2) MSN dendrites are more excitable than those of D(1) MSNs and that DA depletion exaggerates this asymmetry, potentially contributing to adaptations in PD models.},

title = {The neural correlates of motor skill automaticity},
abstract = {Acquisition of a new skill is generally associated with a decrease in the need for effortful control over performance, leading to the development of automaticity. Automaticity by definition has been achieved when performance of a primary task is minimally affected by other ongoing tasks. The neural basis of automaticity was examined by testing subjects in a serial reaction time (SRT) task under both single-task and dual-task conditions. The diminishing cost of dual-task performance was used as an index for automaticity. Subjects performed the SRT task during two functional magnetic imaging sessions separated by 3 h of behavioral training over multiple days. Behavioral data showed that, by the end of testing, subjects had automated performance of the SRT task. Before behavioral training, performance of the SRT task concurrently with the secondary task elicited activation in a wide network of frontal and striatal regions, as well as parietal lobe. After extensive behavioral training, dual-task performance showed comparatively less activity in bilateral ventral premotor regions, right middle frontal gyrus, and right caudate body; activity in other prefrontal and striatal regions decreased equally for single-task and dual-task conditions. These data suggest that lateral and dorsolateral prefrontal regions, and their corresponding striatal targets, subserve the executive processes involved in novice dual-task performance. The results also showed that supplementary motor area and putamen/globus pallidus regions showed training-related decreases for sequence conditions but not for random conditions, confirming the role of these regions in the representation of learned motor sequences.},

title = {Tonically active neurons in the primate caudate nucleus and putamen differentially encode instructed motivational outcomes of action},
abstract = {To achieve a goal, animals procure immediately available rewards, escape from aversive events, or endure the absence of rewards. The neuronal substrates for these goal-directed actions include the limbic system and the basal ganglia. In the striatum, tonically active neurons (TANs), presumed cholinergic interneurons, were originally shown to respond to reward-associated stimuli and to evolve their activity through learning. Subsequent studies revealed that they also respond to aversive event-associated stimuli such as an airpuff on the face and that they are less selective to whether the stimuli instruct reward or no reward. To address this paradox, we designed a set of experiments in which macaque monkeys performed a set of visual reaction time tasks while expecting a reward, during escape from an aversive event, and in the absence of a reward. We found that TANs respond to instruction stimuli associated with motivational outcomes (312 of 390; 80%) but not to unassociated ones (51 of 390; 13%), and that they mostly differentiate associated instructions (217 of 312; 70%). We also found that a higher percentage of TANs in the caudate nucleus respond to stimuli associated with motivational outcomes (118 of 128; 92%) than in the putamen (194 of 262; 74%), whereas a higher percentage of TANs in the putamen respond to go signals for the lever release (112 of 262; 43%) than in the caudate nucleus (27 of 128; 21%), especially for an action expecting a reward. These findings suggest a distinct, pivotal role of TANs in the caudate nucleus and putamen in encoding instructed motivational contexts for goal-directed action planning and learning.},

title = {Rapid interhemispheric switching during vocal production in a songbird},
abstract = {To generate complex bilateral motor patterns such as those underlying birdsong, neural activity must be highly coordinated across the two cerebral hemispheres. However, it remains largely elusive how this coordination is achieved given that interhemispheric communication between song-control areas in the avian cerebrum is restricted to projections received from bilaterally connecting areas in the mid- and hindbrain. By electrically stimulating cerebral premotor areas in zebra finches, we find that behavioral effectiveness of stimulation rapidly switches between hemispheres. In time intervals in which stimulation in one hemisphere tends to distort songs, stimulation in the other hemisphere is mostly ineffective, revealing an idiosyncratic form of motor dominance that bounces back and forth between hemispheres like a virtual ping-pong ball. The intervals of lateralized effectiveness are broadly distributed and are unrelated to simple spectral and temporal song features. Such interhemispheric switching could be an important dynamical aspect of neural coordination that may have evolved from simpler pattern generator circuits.},

abstract = {The dopaminergic mechanisms that control reward-motivated behavior are the subject of intense study, but it is yet unclear how, in humans, neural activity in mesolimbic reward-circuitry and its functional neuroimaging correlates are related to dopamine release. To address this question, we obtained functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures of reward-related neural activity and [(11)C]raclopride positron emission tomography measures of dopamine release in the same human participants, while they performed a delayed monetary incentive task. Across the cohort, a positive correlation emerged between neural activity of the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA), the main origin of dopaminergic neurotransmission, during reward anticipation and reward-related [(11)C]raclopride displacement as an index of dopamine release in the ventral striatum, major target of SN/VTA dopamine neurons. Neural activity in the ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens itself also correlated with ventral striatal dopamine release. Additionally, high-reward-related dopamine release was associated with increased activation of limbic structures, such as the amygdala and the hippocampus. The observed correlations of reward-related mesolimbic fMRI activation and dopamine release provide evidence that dopaminergic neurotransmission plays a quantitative role in human mesolimbic reward processing. Moreover, the combined neurochemical and hemodynamic imaging approach used here opens up new perspectives for the investigation of molecular mechanisms underlying human cognition.},

title = {Beta oscillations in a large-scale sensorimotor cortical network: directional influences revealed by Granger causality},
abstract = {Previous studies have shown that synchronized beta frequency (14-30 Hz) oscillations in the primary motor cortex are involved in maintaining steady contractions of contralateral arm and hand muscles. However, little is known about the role of postcentral cortical areas in motor maintenance and their patterns of interaction with motor cortex. We investigated the functional relations of beta-synchronized neuronal assemblies in pre- and postcentral areas of two monkeys as they pressed a hand lever during the wait period of a visual discrimination task. By using power and coherence spectral analysis, we identified a beta-synchronized large-scale network linking pre- and postcentral areas. We then used Granger causality spectra to measure directional influences among recording sites. In both monkeys, strong Granger causal influences were observed from primary somatosensory cortex to both motor cortex and inferior posterior parietal cortex, with the latter area also exerting Granger causal influences on motor cortex. Granger causal influences from motor cortex to postcentral sites, however, were weak in one monkey and not observed in the other. These results are the first, to our knowledge, to demonstrate in awake monkeys that synchronized beta oscillations bind multiple sensorimotor areas into a large-scale network during motor maintenance behavior and carry Granger causal influences from primary somatosensory and inferior posterior parietal cortices to motor cortex.},

title = {Distinct Hippocampal and Basal Ganglia Contributions to Probabilistic Learning and Reversal},
abstract = {Abstract The hippocampus and the basal ganglia are thought to play fundamental and distinct roles in learning and memory, supporting two dissociable memory systems. Interestingly, however, the hippocampus and the basal ganglia have each, separately, been implicated as necessary for reversal learning-the ability to adaptively change a response when previously learned stimulus-outcome contingencies are reversed. Here, we compared the contribution of the hippocampus and the basal ganglia to distinct aspects of learning and reversal. Amnesic subjects with selective hippocampal damage, Parkinson's subjects with disrupted basal ganglia function, and healthy controls were tested on a novel probabilistic learning and reversal paradigm. In this task, reversal can be achieved in two ways: Subjects can reverse a previously learned response, or, they can select a new cue during the reversal phase, effectively "opting out" of the reversal. We found that both patient groups were intact at initial learning, but differed in their ability to reverse. Amnesic subjects failed to reverse, and continued to use the same cue and response learned before the reversal. Parkinson's subjects, by contrast, opted out of the reversal by learning a new cue-outcome association. These results suggest that both the hippocampus and the basal ganglia support reversal learning, but in different ways. The basal ganglia are necessary for learning a new response when a previously learned response is no longer rewarding. The failure of the amnesic subjects to reverse their response or to learn a new cue is consistent with a more general role for the hippocampus in configural learning, and suggests it may also support the ability to respond to changes in cue-outcome contingencies.},

abstract = {We present a framework for understanding how the hippocampus, neocortex, and basal ganglia work together to support cognitive and behavioral function in the mammalian brain. This framework is based on computational tradeoffs that arise in neural network models, where achieving one type of learning function requires very different parameters from those necessary to achieve another form of learning. For example, we dissociate the hippocampus from cortex with respect to general levels of activity, learning rate, and level of overlap between activation patterns. Similarly, the frontal cortex and associated basal ganglia system have important neural specializations not required of the posterior cortex system. Taken together, this overall cognitive architecture, which has been implemented in functioning computational models, provides a rich and often subtle means of explaining a wide range of behavioral and cognitive neuroscience data. Here, we summarize recent results in the domains of recognition memory, contextual fear conditioning, effects of basal ganglia lesions on stimulus-response and place learning, and flexible responding.},

abstract = {Midbrain dopaminergic neurons (DANs) typically increase their discharge rate in response to appetitive predictive cues and outcomes, whereas striatal cholinergic tonically active interneurons (TANs) decrease their rate. This may indicate that the activity of TANs and DANs is negatively correlated and that TANs can broaden the basal ganglia reinforcement teaching signal, for instance by encoding worse than predicted events. We studied the activity of 106 DANs and 180 TANs of two monkeys recorded during the performance of a classical conditioning task with cues predicting the probability of food, neutral, and air puff outcomes. DANs responded to all cues with elevations of discharge rate, whereas TANs depressed their discharge rate. Nevertheless, although dopaminergic responses to appetitive cues were larger than their responses to neutral or aversive cues, the TAN responses were more similar. Both TANs and DANs responded faster to an air puff than to a food outcome; however, DANs responded with a discharge elevation, whereas the TAN responses included major negative and positive deflections. Finally, food versus air puff omission was better encoded by TANs. In terms of the activity of single neurons with distinct responses to the different behavioral events, both DANs and TANs were more strongly modulated by reward than by aversive related events and better reflected the probability of reward than aversive outcome. Thus, TANs and DANs encode the task episodes differentially. The DANs encode mainly the cue and outcome delivery, whereas the TANs mainly encode outcome delivery and omission at termination of the behavioral trial episode.},

title = {Memory encoding and dopamine in the aging brain: a psychopharmacological neuroimaging study},
abstract = {Normal aging brings with it changes in dopaminergic and memory functions. However, little is known about how these 2 changes are related. In this study, we identify a link between dopamine, episodic memory networks, and aging, using pharmacological functional magnetic resonance imaging. Young and older adults received a D2-like agonist (Bromocriptine, 1.25 mg), a D2-like antagonist (Sulpiride, 400 mg), and Placebo, in a double-blind crossover procedure. We observed group differences, during memory encoding, in medial temporal, frontal, and striatal regions and moreover, these regions were differentially sensitive across groups to dopaminergic perturbation. These findings suggest that brain systems underlying memory show age-related changes and that dopaminergic function may be key in understanding these changes. That these changes have behavioral consequences was suggested by the observation that drug modulations were most pronounced in older subjects with poorer recognition memory. Our findings provide direct evidence linking ageing, memory, and dopaminergic change.},

title = {Opposing patterns of signaling activation in dopamine D1 and D2 receptor-expressing striatal neurons in response to cocaine and haloperidol},
abstract = {Psychostimulants and other drugs of abuse activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in the striatum, through combined stimulation of dopamine D(1) receptors (D1Rs) and glutamate NMDA receptors. Antipsychotic drugs activate similar signaling proteins in the striatum by blocking dopamine D(2) receptors (D2Rs). However, the neurons in which these pathways are activated by psychotropic drugs are not precisely identified. We used transgenic mice, in which enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression was driven by D1R promoter (drd1a-EGFP) or D2R promoter (drd2-EGFP). We confirmed the expression of drd1a-EGFP in striatonigral and drd2-EGFP in striatopallidal neurons. Drd2-EGFP was also expressed in cholinergic interneurons, whereas no expression of either promoter was detected in GABAergic interneurons. Acute cocaine treatment increased phosphorylation of ERK and its direct or indirect nuclear targets, mitogen- and stress-activated kinase-1 (MSK1) and histone H3, exclusively in D1R-expressing output neurons in the dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens. Cocaine-induced expression of c-Fos and Zif268 predominated in D1R-expressing neurons but was also observed in D2R-expressing neurons. One week after repeated cocaine administration, cocaine-induced signaling responses were decreased, with the exception of enhanced ERK phosphorylation in dorsal striatum. The responses remained confined to D1R neurons. In contrast, acute haloperidol injection activated phosphorylation of ERK, MSK1, and H3 only in D2R neurons and induced c-fos and zif268 predominantly in these neurons. Our results demonstrate that cocaine and haloperidol specifically activate signaling pathways in two completely segregated populations of striatal output neurons, providing direct evidence for the selective mechanisms by which these drugs exert their long-term effects.},

TPM imaging studies of neuronal structures over intervals ranging from seconds to years have begun to provide important insights into the structural plasticity of synapses and the modulating effects of experience in the intact brain. TPM has also started to reveal how neuronal connections are altered in animal models of neurodegeneration, acute brain injury, and cerebrovascular disease. Here, we review some of these studies with special emphasis on the degree of structural dynamism of postsynaptic dendritic spines in the adult mouse brain as well as synaptic pathology in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease and cerebral ischemia. We also discuss technical considerations that are critical for the acquisition and interpretation of data from TPM in vivo.},

title = {Still at the choice-point: action selection and initiation in instrumental conditioning},
abstract = {Contrary to classic stimulus-response (S-R) theory, recent evidence suggests that, in instrumental conditioning, rats encode the relationship between their actions and the specific consequences that these actions produce. It has remained unclear, however, how encoding this relationship acts to control instrumental performance. Although S-R theories were able to give a clear account of how learning translates into performance, the argument that instrumental learning constitutes the acquisition of information of the form "response R leads to outcome O" does not directly imply a particular performance rule or policy; this information can be used both to perform R and to avoid performing R. Recognition of this problem has forced the development of accounts that allow the O and stimuli that predict the O (i.e., S-O) to play a role in the initiation of specific Rs. In recent experiments, we have used a variety of behavioral procedures in an attempt to isolate the processes that contribute to instrumental performance, including outcome devaluation, reinstatement, and Pavlovian-instrumental transfer. Our results, particularly from experiments assessing outcome-selective reinstatement, suggest that both "feed-forward" (O-R) and "feed-back" (R-O) associations are critical and that although the former appear to be important to response selection, the latter-together with processes that determine outcome value-mediate response initiation. We discuss a conceptual model that integrates these processes and its neural implementation.},

title = {Statistical limitations in functional neuroimaging. II. Signal detection and statistical inference},
abstract = {The field of functional neuroimaging (FNI) methodology has developed into a mature but evolving area of knowledge and its applications have been extensive. A general problem in the analysis of FNI data is finding a signal embedded in noise. This is sometimes called signal detection. Signal detection theory focuses in general on issues relating to the optimization of conditions for separating the signal from noise. When methods from probability theory and mathematical statistics are directly applied in this procedure it is also called statistical inference. In this paper we briefly discuss some aspects of signal detection theory relevant to FNI and, in addition, some common approaches to statistical inference used in FNI. Low-pass filtering in relation to functional-anatomical variability and some effects of filtering on signal detection of interest to FNI are discussed. Also, some general aspects of hypothesis testing and statistical inference are discussed. This includes the need for characterizing the signal in data when the null hypothesis is rejected, the problem of multiple comparisons that is central to FNI data analysis, omnibus tests and some issues related to statistical power in the context of FNI. In turn, random field, scale space, non-parametric and Monte Carlo approaches are reviewed, representing the most common approaches to statistical inference used in FNI. Complementary to these issues an overview and discussion of non-inferential descriptive methods, common statistical models and the problem of model selection is given in a companion paper. In general, model selection is an important prelude to subsequent statistical inference. The emphasis in both papers is on the assumptions and inherent limitations of the methods presented. Most of the methods described here generally serve their purposes well when the inherent assumptions and limitations are taken into account. Significant differences in results between different methods are most apparent in extreme parameter ranges, for example at low effective degrees of freedom or at small spatial autocorrelation. In such situations or in situations when assumptions and approximations are seriously violated it is of central importance to choose the most suitable method in order to obtain valid results.},

title = {Nonlinear event-related responses in fMRI},
abstract = {This paper presents an approach to characterizing evoked hemodynamic responses in fMRI based on nonlinear system identification, in particular the use of Volterra series. The approach employed enables one to estimate Volterra kernels that describe the relationship between stimulus presentation and the hemodynamic responses that ensue. Volterra series are essentially high-order extensions of linear convolution or "smoothing." These kernels, therefore, represent a nonlinear characterization of the hemodynamic response function that can model the responses to stimuli in different contexts (in this work, different rates of word presentation) and interactions among stimuli. The nonlinear components of the responses were shown to be statistically significant, and the kernel estimates were validated using an independent event-related fMRI experiment. One important manifestation of these nonlinear effects is a modulation of stimulus-specific responses by preceding stimuli that are proximate in time. This means that responses at high-stimulus presentation rates saturate and, in some instances, show an inverted U behavior. This behavior appears to be specific to BOLD effects (as distinct from evoked changes in cerebral blood flow) and may represent a hemodynamic "refractoriness." The aim of this paper is to describe the theory and techniques upon which these conclusions were based and to discuss the implications for experimental design and analysis.},

These effects are evaluated using an empirical data set consisting of regional cerebral blood flow values from 22 regions of interest in 46 depressed adults and 48 age-matched normal controls obtained by 133Xe single photon emission computed tomography. Results show that normalization method has substantial but different effects on characteristics of the data and statistical results. The rationing method appears to be an optimal choice for most analyses.},

abstract = {This study compared the contribution of the general activating and specific cueing properties of Pavlovian stimuli to Pavlovian-instrumental transfer (PIT) and the role of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in mediating these effects. In Experiment 1, hungry rats initially received Pavlovian training, in which three distinct auditory stimuli predicted the delivery of three different food outcomes. Next, the rats were trained to perform two instrumental actions, each earning a unique outcome selected from the three used in Pavlovian conditioning. Finally, the effects of the three stimuli on performance of the two actions were assessed in extinction. Presentation of a stimulus that had been paired with the same outcome as an action increased its performance relative to the other action, demonstrating that PIT effects can be outcome selective. In contrast, presentation of the stimulus that predicted the outcome that was not earned during instrumental training facilitated the performance of both actions indiscriminately. This effect, but not the outcome-selective effect, was abolished by a shift from a hungry to a relatively sated state. Experiment 2 examined the effects of inactivation of the VTA on these two forms of PIT. VTA inactivation was found to attenuate PIT but, unlike satiety, did not appear to differentially affect the general or the outcome-selective forms of PIT. The VTA appears therefore to play an important but general role in the initiation of instrumental actions, enabling cues to influence performance whether they enhance responding by changes in arousal or by retrieving particular actions based on their consequences.},

abstract = {In the present study, we aimed to dissociate the neural correlates of two subprocesses involved in the preparatory period in the context of arbitrary, prelearned stimulus-response (S-R) associations, namely, S-R mapping and movement planning (MP). We teased apart these two subprocesses by comparing three tasks in which the complexity of both S-R mapping and MP were independently manipulated: simple reaction time (SRT) task, go/no-go reaction time (GNGRT) task, and choice reaction time (CRT) task. We found that a more complex S-R mapping, which is the common element differentiating CRT and GNGRT from SRT, was associated with higher brain activation in the left superior parietal lobe (SPL). Conversely, a greater number of planned finger movements, which is the common difference between CRT and both SRT and GNGRT, was associated with higher brain activation in a number of frontal areas, including the left supplementary motor area (SMA), left dorsal premotor cortex (dPM), and left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The left-hemisphere dominance for S-R mapping could be related to the fact that arbitrary S-R mapping is often verbally mediated in humans. Overall, these results suggest a clear dissociation in the preparatory-set period between the more abstract role of left SPL in activating the appropriate S-R associations and the more concrete role played by the SMA, dPM, and ACC in preparing the required motor programs.},

title = {Principal neuron spiking: neither necessary nor sufficient for cerebral blood flow in rat cerebellum},
abstract = {Neuronal activity, cerebral blood flow, and metabolic responses are all strongly coupled, although the mechanisms behind the coupling remain unclear. One of the key questions is whether or not increases in spiking activity in the stimulated neurons are sufficient to drive the activity-dependent rises in cerebral blood flow (CBF) that form the basis of the signals used in functional neuroimaging such as the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal. To this end the present study examined the effect of enhanced spike activity per se on CBF in rat cerebellar cortex under conditions of disinhibition, achieved by blocking GABA(A) receptors using either bicuculline or picrotoxin. Purkinje cell spiking activity and local field potentials were recorded by glass microelectrodes, and laser Doppler flowmetry was used to monitor CBF. Disinhibition increased Purkinje cell spiking rate to 200-300% of control without incurring any increase in basal CBF. This demonstrates that increased spike activity per se is not sufficient to affect basal CBF. The neurovascular coupling between excitatory synaptic activity and CBF responses evoked by inferior olive (climbing fibre) stimulation was preserved during disinhibition. Thus, the unchanged basal CBF in the presence of the dramatic rise in Purkinje cell spiking rate was not explained by impaired synaptic activity-CBF coupling. On the basis of our previous and the present studies, we conclude that increased spiking activity of principal neurons is neither sufficient nor necessary to elicit CBF responses and in turn BOLD signals, and that activation-dependent vascular signals reflect excitatory synaptic activity.},

title = {Cerebral changes during performance of overlearned arbitrary visuomotor associations},
abstract = {The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is known to be involved in the control of automatic movements that are spatially guided, such as grasping an apple. We considered whether the PPC might also contribute to the performance of visuomotor associations in which stimuli and responses are linked arbitrarily, such as producing a certain sound for a typographical character when reading aloud or pressing pedals according to the color of a traffic light when driving a motor vehicle. The PPC does not appear to be necessary for learning new arbitrary visuomotor associations, but with extensive training, the PPC can encode nonspatial sensory features of task-relevant cues. Accordingly, we have tested whether the contributions of the PPC might become apparent once arbitrary sensorimotor mappings are overlearned. We have used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure cerebral activity while subjects were learning novel arbitrary visuomotor associations, overlearning known mappings, or attempting to learn frequently changing novel mappings. To capture the dynamic features of cerebral activity related to the learning process, we have compared time-varying modulations of activity between conditions rather than average (steady-state) responses. Frontal, striatal, and intraparietal regions showed decreasing or stable activity when subjects learned or attempted to learn novel associations, respectively. Importantly, the same frontal, striatal, and intraparietal regions showed time-dependent increases in activity over time as the mappings become overlearned, i.e., despite time-invariant behavioral responses. The automaticity of these mappings predicted the degree of intraparietal changes, indicating that the contribution of the PPC might be related to a particular stage of the overlearning process. We suggest that, as the visuomotor mappings become robust to interference, the PPC may convey relevant sensory information toward the motor cortex. More generally, our findings illustrate how rich cerebral dynamics can underlie stable behavior.},

title = {Uncertainty, neuromodulation, and attention},
abstract = {Uncertainty in various forms plagues our interactions with the environment. In a Bayesian statistical framework, optimal inference and prediction, based on unreliable observations in changing contexts, require the representation and manipulation of different forms of uncertainty. We propose that the neuromodulators acetylcholine and norepinephrine play a major role in the brain's implementation of these uncertainty computations. Acetylcholine signals expected uncertainty, coming from known unreliability of predictive cues within a context. Norepinephrine signals unexpected uncertainty, as when unsignaled context switches produce strongly unexpected observations. These uncertainty signals interact to enable optimal inference and learning in noisy and changeable environments. This formulation is consistent with a wealth of physiological, pharmacological, and behavioral data implicating acetylcholine and norepinephrine in specific aspects of a range of cognitive processes. Moreover, the model suggests a class of attentional cueing tasks that involve both neuromodulators and shows how their interactions may be part-antagonistic, part-synergistic.},

abstract = {How does attention interact with learning? Kruschke [Kruschke, J.K. (2001). Toward a unified Model of Attention in Associative Learning. J. Math. Psychol. 45, 812-863.] proposed a model (EXIT) that captures Mackintosh's [Mackintosh, N.J. (1975). A theory of attention: Variations in the associability of stimuli with reinforcement. Psychological Review, 82(4), 276-298.] framework for attentional modulation of associative learning. We developed a computational model that showed analogous interactions between selective attention and associative learning, but is significantly simplified and, in contrast to EXIT, is motivated by neurophysiological findings. Competition among input representations in the internal representation layer, which increases the contrast between stimuli, is critical for simulating these interactions in human behavior. Furthermore, this competition is modulated in a way that might be consistent with the phasic activation of the central cholinergic system, which modulates activity in sensory cortices. Specifically, phasic increases in acetylcholine can cause increased excitability of both pyramidal excitatory neurons in cortical layers II/III and cortical GABAergic inhibitory interneurons targeting the same pyramidal neurons. These effects result in increased attentional contrast in our model. This model thus represents an initial attempt to link human attentional learning data with underlying neural substrates.},

title = {Brain mechanism of reward prediction under predictable and unpredictable environmental dynamics},
abstract = {In learning goal-directed behaviors, an agent has to consider not only the reward given at each state but also the consequences of dynamic state transitions associated with action selection. To understand brain mechanisms for action learning under predictable and unpredictable environmental dynamics, we measured brain activities by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a Markov decision task with predictable and unpredictable state transitions. Whereas the striatum and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) were significantly activated both under predictable and unpredictable state transition rules, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was more strongly activated under predictable than under unpredictable state transition rules. We then modelled subjects' choice behaviours using a reinforcement learning model and a Bayesian estimation framework and found that the subjects took larger temporal discount factors under predictable state transition rules. Model-based analysis of fMRI data revealed different engagement of striatum in reward prediction under different state transition dynamics. The ventral striatum was involved in reward prediction under both unpredictable and predictable state transition rules, although the dorsal striatum was dominantly involved in reward prediction under predictable rules. These results suggest different learning systems in the cortico-striatum loops depending on the dynamics of the environment: the OFC-ventral striatum loop is involved in action learning based on the present state, while the DLPFC-dorsal striatum loop is involved in action learning based on predictable future states.},

Early perspectives emphasized a role for the striatum in habitual learning of stimulus-response associations and sequences of actions. Recent advances from human neuroimaging research suggest a broader role for the striatum in motivated learning. New findings demonstrate that the striatum represents multiple learning signals and highlight the contribution of the striatum across many cognitive domains and contexts. Recent findings also emphasize interactions between the striatum and other specialized brain systems for learning. Together, these findings suggest that the striatum contributes to a distributed network that learns to select actions based on their predicted value in order to optimize behavior.},

title = {The influence of amphetamine on sensory and conditioned reinforcement: evidence for the re-selection hypothesis of dopamine function},
abstract = {In four experiments we assessed the effect of systemic amphetamine on the ability of a stimulus paired with reward and a stimulus that was not paired with reward to support instrumental conditioning; i.e., we trained rats to press two levers, one followed by a stimulus that had been trained in a predictive relationship with a food outcome and the other by a stimulus unpaired with that reward. Here we show, in general accord with predictions from the dopamine re-selection hypothesis [Redgrave and Gurney (2006). Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 7, 967-975], that systemic amphetamine greatly enhanced the performance of lever press responses that delivered a visual stimulus whether that stimulus had been paired with reward or not. In contrast, amphetamine had no effect on the performance of responses on an inactive lever that had no stimulus consequences. These results support the notion that dopaminergic activity serves to mark or tag actions associated with stimulus change for subsequent selection (or re-selection) and stand against the more specific suggestion that dopaminergic activity is solely related to the prediction of reward.},

Here, we provide behavioural data showing that the incidental presentation of aversive and appetitive conditioned stimuli can alter subjects' preferences in an economic task, involving a choice between a safe or gamble option. These behavioural effects informed a model-based analysis of a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment, involving an identical paradigm, where we demonstrate that this conditioned behavioral bias engages the amygdala, a brain structure associated with acquisition and expression of conditioned associations. Our findings suggest that a well known bias in human economic choice can arise from an influence of conditioned associations on goal-directed decision making, consistent with an architecture of choice that invokes distinct decision-making systems.},

We investigated the mechanisms of probabilistic classification learning in humans using functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the effects of feedback and uncertainty. The design was optimized for separating neural responses to stimulus, delay, and negative and positive feedback components. Compared with fixation, stimulus and feedback activated brain regions consistent with the MDS, whereas the delay period did not. Midbrain activity was significantly different for negative versus positive feedback (consistent with coding of the "prediction error") and was reliably correlated with the degree of uncertainty as well as with activity in MDS target regions. Purely cognitive feedback apparently engages the same regions as rewarding stimuli, consistent with a broader characterization of this network.},

abstract = {Neuroimaging studies of decision-making have generally related neural activity to objective measures (such as reward magnitude, probability or delay), despite choice preferences being subjective. However, economic theories posit that decision-makers behave as though different options have different subjective values. Here we use functional magnetic resonance imaging to show that neural activity in several brain regions--particularly the ventral striatum, medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex--tracks the revealed subjective value of delayed monetary rewards. This similarity provides unambiguous evidence that the subjective value of potential rewards is explicitly represented in the human brain.},

title = {Ventral pallidal representation of pavlovian cues and reward: population and rate codes},
abstract = {We recorded neural activity in the ventral pallidum (VP) while rats learned a pavlovian reward association. Rats learned to distinguish a tone that predicted sucrose pellets (CS+) from a different tone that predicted nothing (CS-). Many VP units became responsive to CS+, but few units responded to CS-. When two CS+ were encountered sequentially, the earliest predictor of reward became most potent. Many VP units were also activated when the sucrose reward was received [unconditioned stimulus (UCS)]. These VP units for UCS remained responsive to sucrose reward after learning, even when sucrose was already predicted by CS+. Neural representation of reward learning and reward itself was characterized by population codes. The population of units that responded to CS+ increased with learning, whereas the population that responded to UCS did not change. A relative firing rate code also represented the identities of conditioned stimuli and UCS. Firing rate differences among stimuli were acquired early and remained stable during subsequent training, whereas population codes and behavioral conditioned responses continued to develop during subsequent training. Thus, the VP makes use of dynamic CS population and rate codes to encode pavlovian reward cues in reward learning and uses stable UCS population and firing codes to encode sucrose reward itself.},

abstract = {The PFC plays a central role in our ability to learn arbitrary rules, such as "green means go." Previous experiments from our laboratory have used conditional association learning to show that slow, gradual changes in PFC neural activity mirror monkeys' slow acquisition of associations. These previous experiments required monkeys to repeatedly reverse the cue-saccade associations, an ability known to be PFC-dependent. We aimed to test whether the relationship between PFC neural activity and behavior was due to the reversal requirement, so monkeys were trained to learn several new conditional cue-saccade associations without reversing them. Learning-related changes in PFC activity now appeared earlier and more suddenly in correspondence with similar changes in behavioral improvement. This suggests that learning of conditional associations is linked to PFC activity regardless of whether reversals are required. However, when previous learning does not need to be suppressed, PFC acquires associations more rapidly.},

title = {Statistics of midbrain dopamine neuron spike trains in the awake primate},
abstract = {Work in behaving primates indicates that midbrain dopamine neurons encode a prediction error, the difference between an obtained reward and the reward expected. Studies of dopamine action potential timing in the alert and anesthetized rat indicate that dopamine neurons respond in tonic and phasic modes, a distinction that has been less well characterized in the primates. We used spike train models to examine the relationship between the tonic and burst modes of activity in dopamine neurons while monkeys were performing a reinforced visuo-saccadic movement task. We studied spiking activity during four task-related intervals; two of these were intervals during which no task-related events occurred, whereas two were periods marked by task-related phasic activity. We found that dopamine neuron spike trains during the intervals when no events occurred were well described as tonic. Action potentials appeared to be independent, to occur at low frequency, and to be almost equally well described by Gaussian and Poisson-like (gamma) processes. Unlike in the rat, interspike intervals as low as 20 ms were often observed during these presumptively tonic epochs. Having identified these periods of presumptively tonic activity, we were able to quantitatively define phasic modulations (both increases and decreases in activity) during the intervals in which task-related events occurred. This analysis revealed that the phasic modulations of these neurons include both bursting, as has been described previously, and pausing. Together bursts and pauses seemed to provide a continuous, although nonlinear, representation of the theoretically defined reward prediction error of reinforcement learning.},

A statistical account can offer a new, principled interpretation of behavior, and previous experiments and theories can inform many unexplored aspects of the Bayesian enterprise. Here we consider one such issue: the finding that surprising events provoke animals to learn faster. We suggest that, in a statistical account of conditioning, surprise signals change and therefore uncertainty and the need for new learning. We discuss inference in a world that changes and show how experimental results involving surprise can be interpreted from this perspective, and also how, thus understood, these phenomena help constrain statistical theories of animal and human learning.},

abstract = {Human subjects are extremely efficient at categorizing natural scenes, despite the fact that different classes of natural scenes often share similar image statistics. Thus far, however, it is unknown where and how complex natural scene categories are encoded and discriminated in the brain. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and distributed pattern analysis to ask what regions of the brain can differentiate natural scene categories (such as forests vs mountains vs beaches). Using completely different exemplars of six natural scene categories for training and testing ensured that the classification algorithm was learning patterns associated with the category in general and not specific exemplars. We found that area V1, the parahippocampal place area (PPA), retrosplenial cortex (RSC), and lateral occipital complex (LOC) all contain information that distinguishes among natural scene categories. More importantly, correlations with human behavioral experiments suggest that the information present in the PPA, RSC, and LOC is likely to contribute to natural scene categorization by humans. Specifically, error patterns of predictions based on fMRI signals in these areas were significantly correlated with the behavioral errors of the subjects. Furthermore, both behavioral categorization performance and predictions from PPA exhibited a significant decrease in accuracy when scenes were presented up-down inverted. Together these results suggest that a network of regions, including the PPA, RSC, and LOC, contribute to the human ability to categorize natural scenes.},

Here we recorded from the ventral tegmental area in rats learning to choose between differently delayed and sized rewards. As expected, the activity of many putative dopamine neurons reflected reward prediction errors, changing when the value of the reward increased or decreased unexpectedly. During learning, neural responses to reward in these neurons waned and responses to cues that predicted reward emerged. Notably, this cue-evoked activity varied with size and delay. Moreover, when rats were given a choice between two differently valued outcomes, the activity of the neurons initially reflected the more valuable option, even when it was not subsequently selected.},

The purpose of the present review is to summarize our current knowledge of the diversity and neurochemical features of the nine dopamine-containing neuronal cell groups in the mammalian brain, their distinctive cellular properties, and their ability to regulate their dopaminergic transmitter machinery in response to altered functional demands and aging.},

abstract = {It has been proposed that nucleus accumbens neurons respond to outcome (reward and punishment) and outcome-predictive information. Alternatively, it has been suggested that these neurons respond to salient stimuli, regardless of their outcome-predictive properties, to facilitate a switch in ongoing behavior. We recorded the activity of 82 single-nucleus accumbens neurons in thirsty rats responding within a modified go/no-go task. The task design allowed us to analyze whether neurons responded to conditioned stimuli that predicted rewarding (saccharin) or aversive (quinine) outcomes, and whether the neural responses correlated with behavioral switching. Approximately one third (28/82) of nucleus accumbens neurons exhibited 35 responses to conditioned stimuli. Over 2/3 of these responses encoded the nature of the upcoming rewarding (19/35) or aversive (5/35) outcome. No response was selective solely for the switching of the rat's behavior, although the activity of approximately one third of responses (11/35) predicted the upcoming outcome and was correlated with the presence or absence of a subsequent behavioral switch. Our data suggest a primary functional role for the nucleus accumbens in encoding outcome-predicting information and a more limited role in behavioral switching.},

Trials comprised an initial "prospect" (expectancy) phase, when a set of three monetary amounts was displayed, and a subsequent "outcome" phase, when one of these amounts was awarded. Hemodynamic responses in the sublenticular extended amygdala (SLEA) and orbital gyrus tracked the expected values of the prospects, and responses to the highest value set of outcomes increased monotonically with monetary value in the nucleus accumbens, SLEA, and hypothalamus. Responses to prospects and outcomes were generally, but not always, seen in the same regions. The overlap of the observed activations with those seen previously in response to tactile stimuli, gustatory stimuli, and euphoria-inducing drugs is consistent with a contribution of common circuitry to the processing of diverse rewards.},

title = {The arbitration-extension hypothesis: a hierarchical interpretation of the functional organization of the Basal Ganglia},
abstract = {BASED ON KNOWN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY, WE PRESENT A HYPOTHESIS WHERE THE BASAL GANGLIA MOTOR LOOP IS HIERARCHICALLY ORGANIZED IN TWO MAIN SUBSYSTEMS: the arbitration system and the extension system. The arbitration system, comprised of the subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus, and pedunculopontine nucleus, serves the role of selecting one out of several candidate actions as they are ascending from various brain stem motor regions and aggregated in the centromedian thalamus or descending from the extension system or from the cerebral cortex. This system is an action-input/action-output system whose winner-take-all mechanism finds the strongest response among several candidates to execute. This decision is communicated back to the brain stem by facilitating the desired action via cholinergic/glutamatergic projections and suppressing conflicting alternatives via GABAergic connections. The extension system, comprised of the striatum and, again, globus pallidus, can extend the repertoire of responses by learning to associate novel complex states to certain actions. This system is a state-input/action-output system, whose organization enables it to encode arbitrarily complex Boolean logic rules using striatal neurons that only fire given specific constellations of inputs (Boolean AND) and pallidal neurons that are silenced by any striatal input (Boolean OR). We demonstrate the capabilities of this hierarchical system by a computational model where a simulated generic "animal" interacts with an environment by selecting direction of movement based on combinations of sensory stimuli, some being appetitive, others aversive or neutral. While the arbitration system can autonomously handle conflicting actions proposed by brain stem motor nuclei, the extension system is required to execute learned actions not suggested by external motor centers. Being precise in the functional role of each component of the system, this hypothesis generates several readily testable predictions.},

abstract = {The phasic firing of dopamine neurons has been theorized to encode a reward-prediction error as formalized by the temporal-difference (TD) algorithm in reinforcement learning. Most TD models of dopamine have assumed a stimulus representation, known as the complete serial compound, in which each moment in a trial is distinctly represented. We introduce a more realistic temporal stimulus representation for the TD model. In our model, all external stimuli, including rewards, spawn a series of internal microstimuli, which grow weaker and more diffuse over time. These microstimuli are used by the TD learning algorithm to generate predictions of future reward. This new stimulus representation injects temporal generalization into the TD model and enhances correspondence between model and data in several experiments, including those when rewards are omitted or received early. This improved fit mostly derives from the absence of large negative errors in the new model, suggesting that dopamine alone can encode the ...},

title = {A comparison of volume-based and surface-based multi-voxel pattern analysis},
abstract = {For functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) has been shown to be a sensitive method to detect areas that encode certain stimulus dimensions. By moving a searchlight through the volume of the brain, one can continuously map the information content about the experimental conditions of interest to the brain. Traditionally, the searchlight is defined as a volume sphere that does not take into account the anatomy of the cortical surface. Here we present a method that uses a cortical surface reconstruction to guide voxel selection for information mapping. This approach differs in two important aspects from a volume-based searchlight definition. First, it uses only voxels that are classified as grey matter based on an anatomical scan. Second, it uses a surface-based geodesic distance metric to define neighbourhoods of voxels, and does not select voxels across a sulcus. We study here the influence of these two factors onto classification accuracy and onto the spatial specificity of the resulting information map. In our example data set, participants pressed one of four fingers while undergoing fMRI. We used MVPA to identify regions in which local fMRI patterns can successfully discriminate which finger was moved. We show that surface-based information mapping is a more sensitive measure of local information content, and provides better spatial selectivity. This makes surface-based information mapping a useful technique for a data-driven analysis of information representation in the cerebral cortex.},

title = {Temporal dynamics of prediction error processing during reward-based decision making},
abstract = {Adaptive decision making depends on the accurate representation of rewards associated with potential choices. These representations can be acquired with reinforcement learning (RL) mechanisms, which use the prediction error (PE, the difference between expected and received rewards) as a learning signal to update reward expectations. While EEG experiments have highlighted the role of feedback-related potentials during performance monitoring, important questions about the temporal sequence of feedback processing and the specific function of feedback-related potentials during reward-based decision making remain. Here, we hypothesized that feedback processing starts with a qualitative evaluation of outcome-valence, which is subsequently complemented by a quantitative representation of PE magnitude. Results of a model-based single-trial analysis of EEG data collected during a reversal learning task showed that around 220ms after feedback outcomes are initially evaluated categorically with respect to their valence (positive vs. negative). Around 300ms, and parallel to the maintained valence-evaluation, the brain also represents quantitative information about PE magnitude, thus providing the complete information needed to update reward expectations and to guide adaptive decision making. Importantly, our single-trial EEG analysis based on PEs from an RL model showed that the feedback-related potentials do not merely reflect error awareness, but rather quantitative information crucial for learning reward contingencies.},

title = {EEG dynamics of the frontoparietal network during reaching preparation in humans},
abstract = {Visuomotor transformation processes are essential when accurate reaching movements towards a visual target have to be performed. In contrast, those transformations are not needed for similar, but non-visually guided, arm movements. According to previous studies, these transformations are carried out by neuronal populations located in the parietal and frontal cortical areas (the so-called "dorsal visual stream"). However, it is still debated whether these processes are mediated by the sequential and/or parallel activation of the frontoparietal areas. To investigate this issue, we designed a task where the same visual cue could represent either the target of a reaching/pointing movement or the go-signal for a similar but non-targeting arm movement. By subtracting the event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded from healthy subjects performing the two conditions, we identified the brain processes underlying the visuomotor transformations needed for accurate reaching/pointing movements. We then localized the generators by means of cortical current density (CCD) reconstruction and studied their dynamics from visual cue presentation to movement onset. The results showed simultaneous activation of the parietal and frontal areas from 140 to 260 ms. The results are interpreted as neural correlates of two critical phases of visuomotor integration, namely target selection and movement selection. Our findings suggest that the visuomotor transformation processes required for correct reaching/pointing movements do not rely on a purely sequential activation of the frontoparietal areas, but mainly on a parallel information processing system, where feedback circuits play an important role before movement onset.},

title = {Overlapping prediction errors in dorsal striatum during instrumental learning with juice and money reward in the human brain},
abstract = {Prediction error signals have been reported in human imaging studies in target areas of dopamine neurons such as ventral and dorsal striatum during learning with many different types of reinforcers. However, a key question that has yet to be addressed is whether prediction error signals recruit distinct or overlapping regions of striatum and elsewhere during learning with different types of reward. To address this, we scanned 17 healthy subjects with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they chose actions to obtain either a pleasant juice reward (1 ml apple juice), or a monetary gain (5 cents) and applied a computational reinforcement learning model to subjects' behavioral and imaging data. Evidence for an overlapping prediction error signal during learning with juice and money rewards was found in a region of dorsal striatum (caudate nucleus), while prediction error signals in a subregion of ventral striatum were significantly stronger during learning with money but not juice reward. These results provide evidence for partially overlapping reward prediction signals for different types of appetitive reinforcers within the striatum, a finding with important implications for understanding the nature of associative encoding in the striatum as a function of reinforcer type.},

title = {Long-term test-retest reliability of functional MRI in a classification learning task},
abstract = {Functional MRI is widely used for imaging the neural correlates of psychological processes and how these brain processes change with learning, development and neuropsychiatric disorder. In order to interpret changes in imaging signals over time, for example, in patient studies, the long-term reliability of fMRI must first be established. Here, eight healthy adult subjects were scanned on two sessions, 1 year apart, while performing a classification learning task known to activate frontostriatal circuitry. We show that behavioral performance and frontostriatal activation were highly concordant at a group level at both time-points. Furthermore, intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs), which index the degree of correlation between subjects at different time-points, were high for behavior and for functional activation. ICC was significantly higher within the network recruited by learning than outside that network. We conclude that fMRI can have high long-term test-retest reliability, making it suitable as a biomarker for brain development and neurodegeneration.},

abstract = {Making successful decisions under uncertainty due to noisy sensory signals is thought to benefit from previous experience. However, the human brain mechanisms that mediate flexible decisions through learning remain largely unknown. Comparing behavioral choices of human observers with those of a pattern classifier based on multivoxel single-trial fMRI signals, we show that category learning shapes processes related to decision variables in frontal and higher occipitotemporal regions rather than signal detection or response execution in primary visual or motor areas. In particular, fMRI signals in prefrontal regions reflect the observers' behavioral choice according to the learned decision criterion only in the context of the categorization task. In contrast, higher occipitotemporal areas show learning-dependent changes in the representation of perceived categories that are sustained after training independent of the task. These findings demonstrate that learning shapes selective representations of sensory readout signals in accordance with the decision criterion to support flexible decisions.},

abstract = {The time histogram method is the most basic tool for capturing a time dependent rate of neuronal spikes. Generally in the neurophysiological literature, the bin size that critically determines the goodness of the fit of the time histogram to the underlying spike rate has been subjectively selected by individual researchers. Here, we propose a method for objectively selecting the bin size from the spike count statistics alone, so that the resulting bar or line graph time histogram best represents the unknown underlying spike rate. For a small number of spike sequences generated from a modestly fluctuating rate, the optimal bin size may diverge, indicating that any time histogram is likely to capture a spurious rate. Given a paucity of data, the method presented here can nevertheless suggest how many experimental trials should be added in order to obtain a meaningful time-dependent histogram with the required accuracy.},

Four different kinds of category-learning tasks are currently popular-rule-based tasks, information-integration tasks, prototype distortion tasks, and the weather prediction task. The cognitive, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging results obtained using these four tasks are qualitatively different. Success in rule-based (explicit reasoning) tasks depends on frontal-striatal circuits and requires working memory and executive attention. Success in information-integration tasks requires a form of procedural learning and is sensitive to the nature and timing of feedback. Prototype distortion tasks induce perceptual (visual cortical) learning. A variety of different strategies can lead to success in the weather prediction task. Collectively, results from these four tasks provide strong evidence that human category learning is mediated by multiple, qualitatively distinct systems.},

abstract = {Historically, different groups of researchers have investigated the mechanisms of perceptual learning and motor learning. For sensory cortex, neurophysiological and psychophysical findings have linked changes in perception with altered neuronal tuning properties. However, less information has been forthcoming from motor cortex. This review compares recent findings on perceptual and motor learning, and suggests that similar mechanisms govern both. These mechanisms involve changes in both the center of neuronal tuning functions and their width or slope. The former reflects the values of the sensory or motor parameters that a neuron encodes, and the latter adjusts the encoding sensitivity. These similarities suggest that specific unifying principles for neural coding and computation exist across sensory and motor domains.},

abstract = {Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is emerging as a key mediator of activity-dependent modifications of synaptic strength in the CNS. We investigated the hypothesis that BDNF enhances quantal neurotransmitter release by modulating the distribution of synaptic vesicles within presynaptic terminals using organotypic slice cultures of postnatal rat hippocampus. BDNF specifically increased the number of docked vesicles at the active zone of excitatory synapses on CA1 dendritic spines, with only a small increase in active zone size. In agreement with the hypothesis that an increased docked vesicle density enhances quantal neurotransmitter release, BDNF increased the frequency, but not the amplitude, of AMPA receptor-mediated miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) recorded from CA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices. Synapse number, independently estimated from dendritic spine density and electron microscopy measurements, was also increased after BDNF treatment, indicating that the actions of BNDF on mEPSC frequency can be partially attributed to an increased synaptic density. Our results further suggest that all these actions were mediated via tyrosine kinase B (TrkB) receptor activation, established by inhibition of plasma membrane tyrosine kinases with K-252a. These results provide additional evidence of a fundamental role of the BDNF-TrkB signaling cascade in synaptic transmission, as well as in cellular models of hippocampus-dependent learning and memory.},

title = {The basal ganglia and cortex implement optimal decision making between alternative actions},
abstract = {Neurophysiological studies have identified a number of brain regions critically involved in solving the problem of action selection or decision making. In the case of highly practiced tasks, these regions include cortical areas hypothesized to integrate evidence supporting alternative actions and the basal ganglia, hypothesized to act as a central switch in gating behavioral requests. However, despite our relatively detailed knowledge of basal ganglia biology and its connectivity with the cortex and numerical simulation studies demonstrating selective function, no formal theoretical framework exists that supplies an algorithmic description of these circuits. This article shows how many aspects of the anatomy and physiology of the circuit involving the cortex and basal ganglia are exactly those required to implement the computation defined by an asymptotically optimal statistical test for decision making: the multihypothesis sequential probability ratio test (MSPRT). The resulting model of basal ganglia provides a new framework for understanding the computation in the basal ganglia during decision making in highly practiced tasks. The predictions of the theory concerning the properties of particular neuronal populations are validated in existing experimental data. Further, we show that this neurobiologically grounded implementation of MSPRT outperforms other candidates for neural decision making, that it is structurally and parametrically robust, and that it can accommodate cortical mechanisms for decision making in a way that complements those in basal ganglia.},

abstract = {Considerable evidence has emerged to implicate ventromedial prefrontal cortex in encoding expectations of future reward during value-based decision making. However, the nature of the learned associations upon which such representations depend is much less clear. Here, we aimed to determine whether expected reward representations in this region could be driven by action-outcome associations, rather than being dependent on the associative value assigned to particular discriminative stimuli. Subjects were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing 2 variants of a simple reward-related decision task. In one version, subjects made choices between 2 different physical motor responses in the absence of discriminative stimuli, whereas in the other version, subjects chose between 2 different stimuli that were randomly assigned to different responses on a trial-by-trial basis. Using an extension of a reinforcement learning algorithm, we found activity in ventromedial prefrontal cortex tracked expected future reward during the action-based task as well as during the stimulus-based task, indicating that value representations in this region can be driven by action-outcome associations. These findings suggest that ventromedial prefrontal cortex may play a role in encoding the value of chosen actions irrespective of whether those actions denote physical motor responses or more abstract decision options.},

title = {Transfer of learning after updating training mediated by the striatum},
abstract = {Process-specific training can improve performance on untrained tasks, but the magnitude of gain is variable and often there is no transfer at all. We demonstrate transfer to a 3-back test of working memory after 5 weeks of training in updating. The transfer effect was based on a joint training-related activity increase for the criterion (letter memory) and transfer tasks in a striatal region that also was recruited pretraining. No transfer was observed to a task that did not engage updating and striatal regions, and age-related striatal changes imposed constraints on transfer. These findings indicate that transfer can occur if the criterion and transfer tasks engage specific overlapping processing components and brain regions.},

annote = {Transfer of ability between similar but different memory tasks is variable. By stdying "updating" using the n-back and another (LM) in both healthy young and healthy old (which have been shown to have striatal changes) Dahlin et al hoped to test the hyptothesis that transfer is due to overlapping neural repressentations. Key finding: old saw no sig transfer, and no sig str activation. However the older population had less cortical activation (medial frontal, pariatal) and had about half the mean recall (across the 5 week training). Commom areas were lit up for young, n-back versus LM. What is the alternate hypothesis, no neural overlap but X? wtf? Stroop (an odd control) showed no str activation, and no transfer. However stroop is a very different task, so whether this is really any evidence at all is unclear to me (I tend to think it is not relelvant) They do conclude that more is required than "overlapping neural systems" for transfer (stroop also saw limited acitvation of frontal and pariatal. I had a better experiment in midn when we first discussed this paper, but cannot now recall it. From Alana: previous transfer research has implicated the striatum.... This is not science worthy.},

title = {Neuronal activity related to anticipated reward in frontal cortex: does it represent value or reflect motivation?},
abstract = {It is thought that neuronal activity in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) represents the value of anticipated reward; however activity in many other brain areas also seems to reflect expected reward value. For example, we have shown that in monkeys performing a memory-guided saccade task for a reward of variable size, activity in numerous areas of frontal cortex is stronger when the monkey anticipates a larger reward. The activity of these neurons might be related to the value of the expected reward or to the degree of motivation induced by expectation of the reward. Anticipation of a more valued reward leads to stronger motivation, as evidenced by measures of arousal, attention, and intensity of motor output. On the assumption that motivated behavior depends on influences arising in the limbic system and acting on the motor system, we hypothesized that neuronal signals representing reward value are unique to OFC, whereas signals arising from other frontal areas, those more closely tied the motor system, reflect the degree of motivation. To test this hypothesis, we recorded from single neurons in OFC and premotor cortex while two monkeys performed a task in which we dissociated value from motivation. Neuronal activity in premotor cortex reflected the monkey's degree of motivation, presumably related to the monkey's level of motor readiness and movement preparation, whereas neuronal activity in OFC represented the value of expected reward.},

title = {A comparison of fMRI adaptation and multivariate pattern classification analysis in visual cortex},
abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has become a ubiquitous tool in cognitive neuroscience. The technique allows noninvasive measurements of cortical responses in the human brain, but only on the millimeter scale. Because a typical voxel contains many thousands of neurons with varied properties, establishing the selectivity of their responses directly is impossible. In recent years, two methods using fMRI aimed at studying the selectivity of neuronal populations on a 'subvoxel' scale have been heavily used. The first technique, fMRI adaptation, relies on the observation that the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response in a given voxel is reduced after prolonged presentation of a stimulus, and that this reduction is selective to the characteristics of the repeated stimuli (adapters). The second technique, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), makes use of multivariate statistics to recover small biases in individual voxels in their responses to different stimuli. It is thought that these biases arise due to the uneven distribution of neurons (with different properties) sampled by the many voxels in the imaged volume. These two techniques have not been compared explicitly, however, and little is known about their relative sensitivities. Here, we compared fMRI results from orientation-specific visual adaptation and orientation-classification by MVPA, using optimized experimental designs for each, and found that the multivariate pattern classification approach was more sensitive to small differences in stimulus orientation than the adaptation paradigm. Estimates of orientation selectivity obtained with the two methods were, however, very highly correlated across visual areas.},

title = {fMRI pattern classification using neuroanatomically constrained boosting},
abstract = {Pattern classification in functional MRI (fMRI) is a novel methodology to automatically identify differences in distributed neural substrates resulting from cognitive tasks. Reliable pattern classification is challenging due to the high dimensionality of fMRI data, the small number of available data sets, interindividual differences, and dependence on the acquisition methodology. Thus, most previous fMRI classification methods were applied in individual subjects. In this study, we developed a novel approach to improve multiclass classification across groups of subjects, field strengths, and fMRI methods. Spatially normalized activation maps were segmented into functional areas using a neuroanatomical atlas and each map was classified separately using local classifiers. A single multiclass output was applied using a weighted aggregation of the classifier's outputs. An Adaboost technique was applied, modified to find the optimal aggregation of a set of spatially distributed classifiers. This Adaboost combined the region-specific classifiers to achieve improved classification accuracy with respect to conventional techniques. Multiclass classification accuracy was assessed in an fMRI group study with interleaved motor, visual, auditory, and cognitive task design. Data were acquired across 18 subjects at different field strengths (1.5 T, 4 T), with different pulse sequence parameters (voxel size and readout bandwidth). Misclassification rates of the boosted classifier were between 3.5% and 10%, whereas for the single classifier, these were between 15% and 23%, suggesting that the boosted classifier provides a better generalization ability together with better robustness. The high computational speed of boosting classification makes it attractive for real-time fMRI to facilitate online interpretation of dynamically changing activation patterns.},

title = {A functional anatomy of anticipatory anxiety},
abstract = {Anticipatory anxiety is a complex combination of a future-oriented cognitive state, negative affect, and autonomic arousal. A dual-task paradigm of anticipation of electric shocks and a motor-learning task was used to examine the changes in neural patterns of activation associated with modulation of the cognitive state in anxiety by a distracting motor task. We used positron emission tomography (PET) and 15O-water to measure regional cerebral blood flow (rcbf) in 10 healthy male volunteers. A 2x2 factorial design-(shock vs no shock) x (low vs high distraction) was used with three scans per condition. Twelve PET scans were performed on each subject. In six of these scans, subjects were given electric shocks. In all scans, subjects also simultaneously performed a motor repetition (low distraction) or learning (high distraction) task. Galvanic skin conductance (GSR), Spielberger State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and self-report data were also collected. In comparisons between the shock and no-shock conditions, the main finding was of increased rcbf in the left insula (-38,8,8) (z = 4.85, P<0.05 corrected) and a homologous area in the right insula at a lower threshold (z =3.20, P = 0.001 uncorrected). Other areas activated were the right superior temporal sulcus, left fusiform, and left anterior cingulate. Using the STAI-state scores as a covariate of interest, significant correlations with rCBF were seen in the left orbitofrontal cortex, left insula, and left anterior cingulate cortex. There was no significant distraction effect as measured by the STAI, self-report, GSR response or interactional analysis of the PET data. These findings support the role of paralimbic structures as neural substrates of anticipatory anxiety. The failure to demonstrate behavioral and neurophysiological changes with the distractor task may reflect the modest increases in anxiety with the shock, the relatively simple distractor task, and small sample size.},

abstract = {The ability to group items and events into functional categories is a fundamental characteristic of sophisticated thought. It is subserved by plasticity in many neural systems, including neocortical regions (sensory, prefrontal, parietal, and motor cortex), the medial temporal lobe, the basal ganglia, and midbrain dopaminergic systems. These systems interact during category learning. Corticostriatal loops may mediate recursive, bootstrapping interactions between fast reward-gated plasticity in the basal ganglia and slow reward-shaded plasticity in the cortex. This can provide a balance between acquisition of details of experiences and generalization across them. Interactions between the corticostriatal loops can integrate perceptual, response, and feedback-related aspects of the task and mediate the shift from novice to skilled performance. The basal ganglia and medial temporal lobe interact competitively or cooperatively, depending on the demands of the learning task.},

Subjects guessed whether the value of a card was higher or lower than the number 5, with monetary rewards as an incentive for correct guesses. They received reward, punishment, or neutral feedback on different trials. Regions in the dorsal and ventral striatum were activated by the paradigm, showing differential responses to reward and punishment.

abstract = {Both dorsal and ventral striatum are implicated in the "habitization" of behavior that occurs in addiction. Here we examined the effect of cocaine exposure on associative encoding in these two regions. Neural activity was recorded during go/no-go discrimination learning and reversal. Activity in ventral striatum developed and reversed rapidly, tracking the valence of the predicted outcome, whereas activity in dorsolateral striatum developed and reversed more slowly, tracking discriminative responding. This difference is consistent with the putative roles of these two areas in promoting habit-like behavior. Dorsolateral striatum has been directly implicated in habit or stimulus-response learning, whereas ventral striatum appears to be involved indirectly by allowing cues associated with reward to exert a general motivational influence on responding. Interestingly cocaine exposure did not uniformly enhance processing across both regions. Instead cocaine reduced the degree and flexibility of cue-evoked firing in ventral striatum while marginally enhanced cue-selective firing in dorsolateral striatum. Thus cocaine exposure causes regionally specific effects on neural processing in striatum; these effects may promote the habitization of behavior by shifting control from ventral to dorsolateral regions.},

abstract = {Competing successfully against an intelligent adversary requires the ability to mentalize an opponent's state of mind to anticipate his/her future behavior. Although much is known about what brain regions are activated during mentalizing, the question of how this function is implemented has received little attention to date. Here we formulated a computational model describing the capacity to mentalize in games. We scanned human subjects with functional MRI while they participated in a simple two-player strategy game and correlated our model against the functional MRI data. Different model components captured activity in distinct parts of the mentalizing network. While medial prefrontal cortex tracked an individual's expectations given the degree of model-predicted influence, posterior superior temporal sulcus was found to correspond to an influence update signal, capturing the difference between expected and actual influence exerted. These results suggest dissociable contributions of different parts of the mentalizing network to the computations underlying higher-order strategizing in humans.},

title = {Dynamic Computation of Incentive Salience: "Wanting" What Was Never "Liked"},
abstract = {Pavlovian cues for rewards become endowed with incentive salience, guiding ``wanting'' to their learned reward. Usually, cues are ``wanted'' only if their rewards have ever been ``liked,'' but here we show that mesocorticolimbic systems can recompute ``wanting'' de novo by integrating novel physiological signals with a cue's preexisting associations to an outcome that lacked hedonic value. That is, a cue's incentive salience can be recomputed adaptively. We demonstrate that this recomputation is encoded in neural signals coursing through the ventral pallidum. Ventral pallidum neurons do not ordinarily fire vigorously to a cue that predicts the previously ``disliked'' taste of intense salt, although they do fire to a cue that predicts the taste of previously ``liked'' sucrose. Yet we show that neural firing rises dramatically to the salt cue immediately and selectively when that cue is encountered in a never-before-experienced state of physiological salt depletion. Crucially, robust neural firing to the salt cue occurred the first time it was encountered in the new depletion state (in cue-only extinction trials), even before its associated intense saltiness has ever been tasted as positively ``liked'' (salt taste had always been ``disliked'' before). The amplification of incentive salience did not require additional learning about the cue or the newly positive salt taste. Thus dynamic recomputation of cue-triggered ``wanting'' signals can occur in real time at the moment of cue re-encounter by combining previously learned Pavlovian associations with novel physiological information about a current state of specific appetite.},

title = {Does the brain have a baseline? Why we should be resisting a rest},
abstract = {In the last few years, the notion that the brain has a default or intrinsic mode of functioning has received increasing attention. The idea derives from observations that a consistent network of brain regions shows high levels of activity when no explicit task is performed and participants are asked simply to rest. The importance of this putative "default mode" is asserted on the basis of the substantial energy demand associated with such a resting state and of the suggestion that rest entails a finely tuned balance between metabolic demand and regionally regulated blood supply. These observations, together with the fact that the default network is more active at rest than it is in a range of explicit tasks, have led some to suggest that it reflects an absolute baseline, one that must be understood and used if we are to develop a comprehensive picture of brain functioning. Here, we examine the assumptions that are generally made in accepting the importance of the "default mode". We question the value, and indeed the interpretability, of the study of the resting state and suggest that observations made under resting conditions have no privileged status as a fundamental metric of brain functioning. In doing so, we challenge the utility of studies of the resting state in a number of important domains of research.},

So that the striatum-based mechanisms underlying habit formation could be studied, chronic recordings from ensembles of striatal neurons were made with multiple tetrodes as rats learned a T-maze procedural task. Large and widely distributed changes in the neuronal activity patterns occurred in the sensorimotor striatum during behavioral acquisition, culminating in task-related activity emphasizing the beginning and end of the automatized procedure. The new ensemble patterns remained stable during weeks of subsequent performance of the same task. These results suggest that the encoding of action in the sensorimotor striatum undergoes dynamic reorganization as habit learning proceeds.},

title = {Inactivation of dorsolateral striatum enhances sensitivity to changes in the action-outcome contingency in instrumental conditioning},
abstract = {Actions become compulsive when they are no longer controlled by their consequences. Compulsivity can be assessed using the omission procedure in which animals are required to withhold a previously reinforced action to earn reward. The current study tested the hypothesis that inactivation of the dorsolateral striatum (DLS), a structure implicated in habitual behavior, can enhance sensitivity to changes in the action-outcome contingency during omission training, thus leading to a reduction in compulsive responding. Over 10 days rats were trained to press a freely available lever for sucrose reward delivered on interval schedules of reinforcement. After learning to press the lever at a stable and high rate, rats in the omission group received a session in which the rewards were now delayed by pressing the lever; i.e. withholding lever pressing resulted in increased access to reward. A control group was yoked to the omission group and received the same number and pattern of reward delivery but without the omission contingency. Half the rats in each group received infusions of vehicle into the DLS prior to this training whereas the remainder received an infusion of the GABA-A receptor agonist muscimol. On the next day, the effect of these treatments was assessed on a probe test in which the tendency of the various groups to press the lever was assessed in extinction and without drug infusion. Rats that received vehicle infusions prior to the omission session showed complete insensitivity to the newly imposed omission contingency. In contrast, rats given the infusion of muscimol selectively reduced lever pressing compared to yoked controls. Thus, extended training with interval schedules resulted in compulsive lever pressing that prevented the learning of the omission contingency, whereas inactivation of the DLS appeared to enhance the rats' sensitivity to this change in the action-outcome contingency.},

abstract = {Humans and other animals change their behavior in response to unexpected outcomes. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is implicated in such adaptive responding, based on evidence from reversal tasks. Yet these tasks confound using information about expected outcomes with learning when those expectations are violated. OFC is critical for the former function; here we show it is also critical for the latter. In a Pavlovian overexpectation task, inactivation of OFC prevented learning driven by unexpected outcomes, even when performance was assessed later. We propose this reflects a critical contribution of outcome signaling by OFC to encoding of reward prediction errors elsewhere. In accord with this proposal, we report that signaling of reward predictions by OFC neurons was related to signaling of prediction errors by dopamine neurons in ventral tegmental area (VTA). Furthermore, bilateral inactivation of VTA or contralateral inactivation of VTA and OFC disrupted learning driven by unexpected outcomes.},

title = {Neural evidence for dissociable components of task-switching},
abstract = {The ability to retrieve and flexibly switch between task rules is seen as an important component of cognitive control. It is often assumed that lateral prefrontal cortex (latPFC) is important for switching between rules. However, activation associated with rule-switching is less reliably observed in latPFC than in medial PFC (specifically, pre-supplementary motor area). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that medial PFC is important for reconfiguration of task sets, whereas latPFC is important for retrieving, maintaining and implementing relevant rules (i.e. rule representation). Twenty young adults participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study in which they determined the correct response to a target stimulus on the basis of an instructional cue. For bivalent targets, the appropriate response depended on the currently relevant rule. In contrast, univalent targets were always associated with the same response. Brain regions of interest were characterized according to their responsiveness to bivalent and univalent targets, on both rule-switch and rule-repetition trials. The data support the hypothesis that rule representation and task-set reconfiguration are separable cognitive processes, associated with dissociable neural activation in latPFC and medial PFC, respectively. Activation profiles of posterior parietal cortex, basal ganglia and rostrolateral PFC are also examined and discussed.},

title = {Encoding network states by striatal cell assemblies},
abstract = {Correlated activity in cortico-basal ganglia circuits plays a key role in the encoding of movement, associative learning and procedural memory. How correlated activity is assembled by striatal microcircuits is not understood. Calcium imaging of striatal neuronal populations, with single-cell resolution, reveals sporadic and asynchronous activity under control conditions. However, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) application induces bistability and correlated activity in striatal neurons. Widespread neurons within the field of observation present burst firing. Sets of neurons exhibit episodes of recurrent and synchronized bursting. Dimensionality reduction of network dynamics reveals functional states defined by cell assemblies that alternate their activity and display spatiotemporal pattern generation. Recurrent synchronous activity travels from one cell assembly to the other often returning to the original assembly; suggesting a robust structure. An initial search into the factors that sustain correlated activity of neuronal assemblies showed a critical dependence on both intrinsic and synaptic mechanisms: blockage of fast glutamatergic transmission annihilates all correlated firing, whereas blockage of GABAergic transmission locked the network into a single dominant state that eliminates assembly diversity. Reduction of L-type Ca(2+)-current restrains synchronization. Each cell assembly comprised different cells, but a small set of neurons was shared by different assemblies. A great proportion of the shared neurons was local interneurons with pacemaking properties. The network dynamics set into action by NMDA in the striatal network may reveal important properties of striatal microcircuits under normal and pathological conditions.},

abstract = {An influential theoretical perspective differentiates in humans an explicit, rule-based system of category learning from an implicit system that slowly associates different regions of perceptual space with different response outputs. This perspective was extended for the 1st time to the category learning of nonhuman primates. Humans (Homo sapiens) and macaques (Macaca mulatta) learned categories composed of sine-wave gratings that varied across trials in bar width and bar orientation. The categories had either a single-dimensional, rule-based solution or a two-dimensional, information-integration solution. Humans strongly dimensionalized the stimuli and learned the rule-based task far more quickly. Six macaques showed the same performance advantage in the rule-based task. In humans, rule-based category learning is linked to explicit cognition, consciousness, and declarative reports about the contents of cognition. These results demonstrate an empirical continuity between human and nonhuman primate cognition, suggesting that nonhuman primates may have some structural components of humans' capacity for explicit cognition.},

Striatal ACh acts presynaptically to polarize powerfully how opposing DAN activities are transduced into DA release. Further- more, characteristic reward-related activities of TANs and DANs are temporally coincident but differently variant with reward probability. Reward-related DA signals could therefore be governed by the concomitant activity in TANs. This article discusses the dynamic implications for DA signalling when these phenomena act in concert. TAN pauses might powerfully enhance the contrast, or salience, of DA signals offered by reward-related bursts, and even by reward omission- related pauses, in DANs. Through such mechanisms, TAN--DAN interactions would be functionally cooperative.},

title = {Beyond the wiring diagram: signalling through complex neuromodulator networks},
abstract = {During the computations performed by the nervous system, its `wiring diagram'---the map of its neurons and synaptic connections---is dynamically modified and supplemented by multiple actions of neuromodulators that can be so complex that they can be thought of as constituting a biochemi- cal network that combines with the neuronal network to perform the computation. Thus, the neuronal wiring diagram alone is not sufficient to specify, and permit us to understand, the compu- tation that underlies behaviour. Here I review how such modulatory networks operate, the problems that their existence poses for the experimental study and conceptual understanding of the compu- tations performed by the nervous system, and how these problems may perhaps be solved and the computations understood by considering the structural and functional `logic' of the modulatory networks.},

title = {A default mode of brain function},
abstract = {A baseline or control state is fundamental to the understanding of most complex systems. Defining a baseline state in the human brain, arguably our most complex system, poses a particular challenge. Many suspect that left unconstrained, its activity will vary unpredictably. Despite this prediction we identify a baseline state of the normal adult human brain in terms of the brain oxygen extraction fraction or OEF. The OEF is defined as the ratio of oxygen used by the brain to oxygen delivered by flowing blood and is remarkably uniform in the awake but resting state (e.g., lying quietly with eyes closed). Local deviations in the OEF represent the physiological basis of signals of changes in neuronal activity obtained with functional MRI during a wide variety of human behaviors. We used quantitative metabolic and circulatory measurements from positron-emission tomography to obtain the OEF regionally throughout the brain. Areas of activation were conspicuous by their absence. All significant deviations from the mean hemisphere OEF were increases, signifying deactivations, and resided almost exclusively in the visual system. Defining the baseline state of an area in this manner attaches meaning to a group of areas that consistently exhibit decreases from this baseline, during a wide variety of goal-directed behaviors monitored with positron-emission tomography and functional MRI. These decreases suggest the existence of an organized, baseline default mode of brain function that is suspended during specific goal-directed behaviors.},

title = {Activity of striatal neurons reflects dynamic encoding and recoding of procedural memories},
abstract = {Learning to perform a behavioural procedure as a well-ingrained habit requires extensive repetition of the behavioural sequence, and learning not to perform such behaviours is notoriously difficult. Yet regaining a habit can occur quickly, with even one or a few exposures to cues previously triggering the behaviour. To identify neural mechanisms that might underlie such learning dynamics, we made long-term recordings from multiple neurons in the sensorimotor striatum, a basal ganglia structure implicated in habit formation, in rats successively trained on a reward-based procedural task, given extinction training and then given reacquisition training. The spike activity of striatal output neurons, nodal points in cortico-basal ganglia circuits, changed markedly across multiple dimensions during each of these phases of learning. First, new patterns of task-related ensemble firing successively formed, reversed and then re-emerged. Second, task-irrelevant firing was suppressed, then rebounded, and then was suppressed again. These changing spike activity patterns were highly correlated with changes in behavioural performance. We propose that these changes in task representation in cortico-basal ganglia circuits represent neural equivalents of the explore-exploit behaviour characteristic of habit learning.},

abstract = {Comparative studies have implicated the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) in the anticipation of incentives, but the relative responsiveness of this neural substrate during anticipation of rewards versus punishments remains unclear. Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated whether the anticipation of increasing monetary rewards and punishments would increase NAcc blood oxygen level-dependent contrast (hereafter, "activation") in eight healthy volunteers. Whereas anticipation of increasing rewards elicited both increasing self-reported happiness and NAcc activation, anticipation of increasing punishment elicited neither. However, anticipation of both rewards and punishments activated a different striatal region (the medial caudate). At the highest reward level ({\$}5.00), NAcc activation was correlated with individual differences in self-reported happiness elicited by the reward cues. These findings suggest that whereas other striatal areas may code for expected incentive magnitude, a region in the NAcc codes for expected positive incentive value.},

abstract = {Theories of the positive symptoms of schizophrenia hypothesize a role for aberrant reinforcement signaling driven by dysregulated dopamine transmission. Recently, we provided evidence of aberrant reward learning in symptomatic, but not asymptomatic patients with schizophrenia, using a novel paradigm, the Salience Attribution Test (SAT). The SAT is a probabilistic reward learning game that employs cues that vary across task-relevant and task-irrelevant dimensions; it provides behavioral indices of adaptive and aberrant reward learning. As an initial step prior to future clinical studies, here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the neural basis of adaptive and aberrant reward learning during the SAT in healthy volunteers. As expected, cues associated with high relative to low reward probabilities elicited robust hemodynamic responses in a network of structures previously implicated in motivational salience; the midbrain, in the vicinity of the ventral tegmental area, and regions targeted by its dopaminergic projections, i.e. medial dorsal thalamus, ventral striatum and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Responses in the medial dorsal thalamus and polar PFC were strongly correlated with the degree of adaptive reward learning across participants. Finally, and most importantly, differential dorsolateral PFC and middle temporal gyrus (MTG) responses to cues with identical reward probabilities were very strongly correlated with the degree of aberrant reward learning. Participants who showed greater aberrant learning exhibited greater dorsolateral PFC responses, and reduced MTG responses, to cues erroneously inferred to be less strongly associated with reward. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for different theories of associative learning.},

abstract = {Independent component analysis (ICA) of fMRI data generates session/individual specific brain activation maps without a priori assumptions regarding the timing or pattern of the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal responses. However, because of a random permutation among output components, ICA does not offer a straightforward solution for the inference of group-level activation. In this study, we present an independent vector analysis (IVA) method to address the permutation problem during fMRI group data analysis. In comparison to ICA, IVA offers an analysis of additional dependent components, which were assigned for use in the automated grouping of dependent activation patterns across subjects. Upon testing using simulated trial-based fMRI data, our proposed method was applied to real fMRI data employing both a single-trial task-paradigm (right hand motor clenching and internal speech generation tasks) and a three-trial task-paradigm (right hand motor imagery task). A generalized linear model (GLM) and the group ICA of the fMRI toolbox (GIFT) were also applied to the same data set for comparison to IVA. Compared to GLM, IVA successfully captured activation patterns even when the functional areas showed variable hemodynamic responses that deviated from a hypothesized response. We also showed that IVA effectively inferred group-activation patterns of unknown origins without the requirement for a pre-processing stage (such as data concatenation in ICA-based GIFT). IVA can be used as a potential alternative or an adjunct to current ICA-based fMRI group processing methods.},

title = {The brain atlas concordance problem: quantitative comparison of anatomical parcellations},
abstract = {Many neuroscientific reports reference discrete macro-anatomical regions of the brain which were delineated according to a brain atlas or parcellation protocol. Currently, however, no widely accepted standards exist for partitioning the cortex and subcortical structures, or for assigning labels to the resulting regions, and many procedures are being actively used. Previous attempts to reconcile neuroanatomical nomenclatures have been largely qualitative, focusing on the development of thesauri or simple semantic mappings between terms. Here we take a fundamentally different approach, discounting the names of regions and instead comparing their definitions as spatial entities in an effort to provide more precise quantitative mappings between anatomical entities as defined by different atlases. We develop an analytical framework for studying this brain atlas concordance problem, and apply these methods in a comparison of eight diverse labeling methods used by the neuroimaging community. These analyses result in conditional probabilities that enable mapping between regions across atlases, which also form the input to graph-based methods for extracting higher-order relationships between sets of regions and to procedures for assessing the global similarity between different parcellations of the same brain. At a global scale, the overall results demonstrate a considerable lack of concordance between available parcellation schemes, falling within chance levels for some atlas pairs. At a finer level, this study reveals spatial relationships between sets of defined regions that are not obviously apparent; these are of high potential interest to researchers faced with the challenge of comparing results that were based on these different anatomical models, particularly when coordinate-based data are not available. The complexity of the spatial overlap patterns revealed points to problems for attempts to reconcile anatomical parcellations and nomenclatures using strictly qualitative and/or categorical methods. Detailed results from this study are made available via an interactive web site at http://obart.info.},

title = {Striatal dopamine predicts outcome-specific reversal learning and its sensitivity to dopaminergic drug administration},
abstract = {Individual variability in reward-based learning has been ascribed to quantitative variation in baseline levels of striatal dopamine. However, direct evidence for this pervasive hypothesis has hitherto been unavailable. We demonstrate that individual differences in reward-based reversal learning reflect variation in baseline striatal dopamine synthesis capacity, as measured with neurochemical positron emission tomography. Subjects with high baseline dopamine synthesis in the striatum showed relatively better reversal learning from unexpected rewards than from unexpected punishments, whereas subjects with low baseline dopamine synthesis in the striatum showed the reverse pattern. In addition, baseline dopamine synthesis predicted the direction of dopaminergic drug effects. The D(2) receptor agonist bromocriptine improved reward-based relative to punishment-based reversal learning in subjects with low baseline dopamine synthesis capacity, while impairing it in subjects with high baseline dopamine synthesis capacity in the striatum. Finally, this pattern of drug effects was outcome-specific, and driven primarily by drug effects on punishment-, but not reward-based reversal learning. These data demonstrate that the effects of D(2) receptor stimulation on reversal learning in humans depend on task demands and baseline striatal dopamine synthesis capacity.},

title = {Ongoing in vivo experience triggers synaptic metaplasticity in the neocortex},
abstract = {In vivo experience can occlude subsequent induction of long-term potentiation and enhance long-term depression of synaptic responses. Although a reduced capacity for synaptic strengthening may function to prevent excessive excitation, such an effect paradoxically implies that continued experience or training should not improve and may even degrade neural representations. In mice, we examined the effect of ongoing whisker stimulation on synaptic strengthening at layer 4-2/3 synapses in the barrel cortex. Although N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors were required to initiate strengthening, they subsequently suppressed further potentiation at these synapses in vitro and in vivo. Despite this transition, synaptic strengthening continued with additional sensory activity but instead required the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors, suggesting a mechanism by which continued experience can result in increasing synaptic strength over time.},

In order to choose which food to consume, it is necessary to maintain a predictive representation of the subjective value of the associated food stimulus. Here, we explore the neural mechanisms by which such predictive representations are learned through classical conditioning. Human subjects were scanned using fMRI while learning associations between arbitrary visual stimuli and subsequent delivery of one of five different food flavors. Using a temporal difference algorithm to model learning, we found predictive responses in the ventral midbrain and a part of ventral striatum (ventral putamen) that were related directly to subjects' actual behavioral preferences. These brain structures demonstrated divergent response profiles, with the ventral midbrain showing a linear response profile with preference, and the ventral striatum a bivalent response. These results provide insight into the neural mechanisms underlying human preference behavior.},

Many theories of vision have been premised on the central role played by prediction. Yet, implicit prediction in human vision has been difficult to assess in the laboratory, and many results have not distinguished between the indisputably important role of memory and the future-oriented aspect of prediction. Now, a new and unexpected finding - that humans can resume an interrupted visual search much faster than they can start a new search - offers new hope, because the rapid resumption of a search seems to depend on participants forming an implicit prediction of what they will see after the interruption. These findings combined with results of recent neurophysiology studies provide a framework for studying implicit prediction in perception.},

abstract = {Many real-life decision-making problems incorporate higher-order structure, involving interdependencies between different stimuli, actions, and subsequent rewards. It is not known whether brain regions implicated in decision making, such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), use a stored model of the task structure to guide choice (model-based decision making) or merely learn action or state values without assuming higher-order structure as in standard reinforcement learning. To discriminate between these possibilities, we scanned human subjects with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they performed a simple decision-making task with higher-order structure, probabilistic reversal learning. We found that neural activity in a key decision-making region, the vmPFC, was more consistent with a computational model that exploits higher-order structure than with simple reinforcement learning. These results suggest that brain regions, such as the vmPFC, use an abstract model of task structure to guide behavioral choice, computations that may underlie the human capacity for complex social interactions and abstract strategizing.},

title = {Is avoiding an aversive outcome rewarding? Neural substrates of avoidance learning in the human brain},
abstract = {Avoidance learning poses a challenge for reinforcement-based theories of instrumental conditioning, because once an aversive outcome is successfully avoided an individual may no longer experience extrinsic reinforcement for their behavior. One possible account for this is to propose that avoiding an aversive outcome is in itself a reward, and thus avoidance behavior is positively reinforced on each trial when the aversive outcome is successfully avoided. In the present study we aimed to test this possibility by determining whether avoidance of an aversive outcome recruits the same neural circuitry as that elicited by a reward itself. We scanned 16 human participants with functional MRI while they performed an instrumental choice task, in which on each trial they chose from one of two actions in order to either win money or else avoid losing money. Neural activity in a region previously implicated in encoding stimulus reward value, the medial orbitofrontal cortex, was found to increase, not only following receipt of reward, but also following successful avoidance of an aversive outcome. This neural signal may itself act as an intrinsic reward, thereby serving to reinforce actions during instrumental avoidance.},

title = {Coherence between fMRI time-series distinguishes two spatial working memory networks},
abstract = {Widespread and distributed brain regions are thought to form networks that together support working memory. We recently demonstrated that different cortical areas maintain relatively different codes across a memory delay (Curtis et. al., J Neurosci, 2004; 24:3944-3952). The frontal eye fields (FEF), for example, were more active during the delay when the direction of the memory-guided saccade was known compared to when it was not known throughout the delay. Other areas showed the opposite pattern. Despite these task-dependent differences in regional activity, we could only assume but not address the functional interactions between the identified nodes of the putative network. Here, we use a bivariate technique, coherence, to formally characterize functional interactions between a seed region and other brain areas. We find that the type of representational codes that are being maintained in working memory biases frontal-parietal interactions. For example, coherence between FEF and other oculomotor areas was greater when a motor representation was an efficient strategy to bridge the delay period. However, coherence between the FEF and higher-order heteromodal areas, e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, was greater when a sensory representation must be maintained in working memory.},

title = {A pallidus-habenula-dopamine pathway signals inferred stimulus values},
abstract = {The reward value of a stimulus can be learned through two distinct mechanisms: reinforcement learning through repeated stimulus-reward pairings and abstract inference based on knowledge of the task at hand. The reinforcement mechanism is often identified with midbrain dopamine neurons. Here we show that a neural pathway controlling the dopamine system does not rely exclusively on either stimulus-reward pairings or abstract inference but instead uses a combination of the two. We trained monkeys to perform a reward-biased saccade task in which the reward values of two saccade targets were related in a systematic manner. Animals used each trial's reward outcome to learn the values of both targets: the target that had been presented and whose reward outcome had been experienced (experienced value) and the target that had not been presented but whose value could be inferred from the reward statistics of the task (inferred value). We then recorded from three populations of reward-coding neurons: substantia nigra dopamine neurons; a major input to dopamine neurons, the lateral habenula; and neurons that project to the lateral habenula, located in the globus pallidus. All three populations encoded both experienced values and inferred values. In some animals, neurons encoded experienced values more strongly than inferred values, and the animals showed behavioral evidence of learning faster from experience than from inference. Our data indicate that the pallidus-habenula-dopamine pathway signals reward values estimated through both experience and inference.},

title = {Multivoxel pattern selectivity for perceptually relevant binocular disparities in the human brain},
abstract = {Processing of binocular disparity is thought to be widespread throughout cortex, highlighting its importance for perception and action. Yet the computations and functional roles underlying this activity across areas remain largely unknown. Here, we trace the neural representations mediating depth perception across human brain areas using multivariate analysis methods and high-resolution imaging. Presenting disparity-defined planes, we determine functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) selectivity to near versus far depth positions. First, we test the perceptual relevance of this selectivity, comparing the pattern-based decoding of fMRI responses evoked by random dot stereograms that support depth perception (correlated RDS) with the decoding of stimuli containing disparities to which the perceptual system is blind (anticorrelated RDS). Preferential disparity selectivity for correlated stimuli in dorsal (visual and parietal) areas and higher ventral area LO (lateral occipital area) suggests encoding of perceptually relevant information, in contrast to early (V1, V2) and intermediate ventral (V3v, V4) visual cortical areas that show similar selectivity for both correlated and anticorrelated stimuli. Second, manipulating disparity parametrically, we show that dorsal areas encode the metric disparity structure of the viewed stimuli (i.e., disparity magnitude), whereas ventral area LO appears to represent depth position in a categorical manner (i.e., disparity sign). Our findings suggest that activity in both visual streams is commensurate with the use of disparity for depth perception but the neural computations may differ. Intriguingly, perceptually relevant responses in the dorsal stream are tuned to disparity content and emerge at a comparatively earlier stage than categorical representations for depth position in the ventral stream.},

abstract = {Learning and memory and navigation literatures emphasize interactions between multiple memory systems: a flexible, planning-based system and a rigid, cached-value system. This has profound implications for decision-making. Recent conceptualizations of flexible decision-making employ prospection and projection arising from a network involving the hippocampus. Recent recordings from rodent hippocampus in decision-making situations have found transient forward-shifted representations. Evaluation of that prediction and subsequent action-selection probably occurs downstream (e.g. in orbitofrontal cortex, in ventral and dorsomedial striatum). Classically, striatum has been identified as a crucial component of the less-flexible, incremental system. Current evidence, however, suggests that striatum is involved in both flexible and stimulus-response decision-making, with dorsolateral striatum involved in stimulus-response strategies and ventral and dorsomedial striatum involved in goal-directed strategies.},

title = {The basal ganglia and cortex implement optimal decision making between alternative actions},
abstract = {Neurophysiological studies have identified a number of brain regions critically involved in solving the problem of action selection or decision making. In the case of highly practiced tasks, these regions include cortical areas hypothesized to integrate evidence supporting alternative actions and the basal ganglia, hypothesized to act as a central switch in gating behavioral requests. However, despite our relatively detailed knowledge of basal ganglia biology and its connectivity with the cortex and numerical simulation studies demonstrating selective function, no formal theoretical framework exists that supplies an algorithmic description of these circuits. This article shows how many aspects of the anatomy and physiology of the circuit involving the cortex and basal ganglia are exactly those required to implement the computation defined by an asymptotically optimal statistical test for decision making: the multihypothesis sequential probability ratio test (MSPRT). The resulting model of basal ganglia provides a new framework for understanding the computation in the basal ganglia during decision making in highly practiced tasks. The predictions of the theory concerning the properties of particular neuronal populations are validated in existing experimental data. Further, we show that this neurobiologically grounded implementation of MSPRT outperforms other candidates for neural decision making, that it is structurally and parametrically robust, and that it can accommodate cortical mechanisms for decision making in a way that complements those in basal ganglia.},

title = {Frontal cortex subregions play distinct roles in choices between actions and stimuli},
abstract = {The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) has been implicated in reinforcement-guided decision making, error monitoring, and the reversal of behavior in response to changing circumstances. The anterior cingulate cortex sulcus (ACC(S)), however, has also been implicated in similar aspects of behavior. Dissociating the unique functions of these areas would improve our understanding of the decision-making process. The effect of selective OFC lesions on how monkeys used the history of reinforcement to guide choices of either particular actions or particular stimuli was studied and compared with the effects of ACC(S) lesions. Both lesions disrupted decision making, but their effects were differentially modulated by the dependence on action- or stimulus-value contingencies. OFC lesions caused a deficit in stimulus but not action selection, whereas ACC(S) lesions had the opposite effect, disrupting action but not stimulus selection. Furthermore, OFC lesions that have previously been found to impair decision making when deterministic stimulus-reward contingencies are switched were found to cause a more general learning impairment in more naturalistic situations in which reward was stochastic. Both OFC and ACC(S) are essential for reinforcement-guided decision making rather than just error monitoring or behavioral reversal. The OFC and ACC(S) are both, however, more concerned with learning and making decisions, but their roles in selecting between stimulus and action values are distinct.},

title = {Neural substrates of visuomotor learning based on improved feedback control and prediction},
abstract = {Motor skills emerge from learning feedforward commands as well as improvements in feedback control. These two components of learning were investigated in a compensatory visuomotor tracking task on a trial-by-trial basis. Between-trial learning was characterized with a state-space model to provide smoothed estimates of feedforward and feedback learning, separable from random fluctuations in motor performance and error. The resultant parameters were correlated with brain activity using magnetic resonance imaging. Learning related to the generation of a feedforward command correlated with activity in dorsal premotor cortex, inferior parietal lobule, supplementary motor area and cingulate motor area, supporting a role of these areas in retrieving and executing a predictive motor command. Modulation of feedback control was associated with activity in bilateral posterior superior parietal lobule as well as right ventral premotor cortex. Performance error correlated with activity in a widespread cortical and subcortical network including bilateral parietal, premotor and rostral anterior cingulate cortex as well as the cerebellar cortex. Finally, trial-by-trial changes of kinematics, as measured by mean absolute hand acceleration, correlated with activity in motor cortex and anterior cerebellum. The results demonstrate that incremental, learning-dependent changes can be modeled on a trial-by-trial basis and neural substrates for feedforward control of novel motor programs are localized to secondary motor areas.},

title = {Processing of social and monetary rewards in the human striatum},
abstract = {Despite an increasing focus on the neural basis of human decision making in neuroscience, relatively little attention has been paid to decision making in social settings. Moreover, although human social decision making has been explored in a social psychology context, few neural explanations for the observed findings have been considered. To bridge this gap and improve models of human social decision making, we investigated whether acquiring a good reputation, which is an important incentive in human social behaviors, activates the same reward circuitry as monetary rewards. In total, 19 subjects participated in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments involving monetary and social rewards. The acquisition of one's good reputation robustly activated reward-related brain areas, notably the striatum, and these overlapped with the areas activated by monetary rewards. Our findings support the idea of a "common neural currency" for rewards and represent an important first step toward a neural explanation for complex human social behaviors.},

title = {Measuring temporal dynamics of functional networks using phase spectrum of fMRI data},
abstract = {We present a novel method to measure relative latencies between functionally connected regions using phase-delay of functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Derived from the phase component of coherency, this quantity estimates the linear delay between two time-series. In conjunction with coherence, derived from the magnitude component of coherency, phase-delay can be used to examine the temporal properties of functional networks. In this paper, we apply coherence and phase-delay methods to fMRI data in order to investigate dynamics of the motor network during task and rest periods. Using the supplementary motor area (SMA) as a reference region, we calculated relative latencies between the SMA and other regions within the motor network including the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), primary motor cortex (M1), and posterior parietal cortex (PPC). During both the task and rest periods, we measured significant delays that were consistent across subjects. Specifically, we found significant delays between the SMA and the bilateral PMd, bilateral M1, and bilateral PPC during the task condition. During the rest condition, we found that the temporal dynamics of the network changed relative to the task period. No significant delays were measured between the SMA and the left PM and left M1; however, the right PM, right M1, and bilateral PPC were significantly delayed with respect to the SMA. Additionally, we observed significant map-wise differences in the dynamics of the network at task compared to the network at rest. These differences were observed in the interaction between the SMA and the left M1, left superior frontal gyrus, and left middle frontal gyrus. These temporal measurements are important in determining how regions within a network interact and provide valuable information about the sequence of cognitive processes within a network.},

title = {Dopaminergic drug effects on physiological connectivity in a human cortico-striato-thalamic system},
abstract = {Cortico-striato-thalamic (CST) systems are anatomical substrates for many motor and executive functions and are implicated in diverse neuropsychiatric disorders. Electrophysiological studies in rats, monkeys and patients with Parkinson's disease have shown that power and coherence of low frequency oscillations in CST systems can be profoundly modulated by dopaminergic drugs. We combined functional MRI with correlational and path analyses to investigate functional and effective connectivity, respectively, of a prefronto-striato-thalamic system activated by object location learning in healthy elderly human subjects (n = 23; mean age = 72 years). Participants were scanned in a repeated measures, randomized, placebo-controlled design to measure modulation of physiological connectivity between CST regions following treatment with drugs which served both to decrease (sulpiride) and increase (methylphenidate) dopaminergic transmission, as well as non-dopaminergic treatments (diazepam and scopolamine) to examine non-specific effects. Functional connectivity of caudate nucleus was modulated specifically by dopaminergic drugs, with opposing effects of sulpiride and methylphenidate. The more salient effect of sulpiride was to increase functional connectivity between caudate and both thalamus and ventral midbrain. A path diagram based on prior knowledge of unidirectional anatomical projections between CST components was fitted satisfactorily to the observed inter-regional covariance matrix. The effect of sulpiride was defined more specifically in the context of this model as increased strength of effective connection from ventral midbrain to caudate nucleus. In short, we have demonstrated enhanced functional and effective connectivity of human caudate nucleus following sulpiride treatment, which is compatible both with the anatomy of ascending dopaminergic projections and with electrophysiological studies indicating abnormal coherent oscillations of CST neurons in parkinsonian states.},

We investigated whether the perception of edge orientation, a fundamental visual feature, can be decoded from human brain activity measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Using statistical algorithms to classify brain states, we found that ensemble fMRI signals in early visual areas could reliably predict on individual trials which of eight stimulus orientations the subject was seeing. Moreover, when subjects had to attend to one of two overlapping orthogonal gratings, feature-based attention strongly biased ensemble activity toward the attended orientation. These results demonstrate that fMRI activity patterns in early visual areas, including primary visual cortex (V1), contain detailed orientation information that can reliably predict subjective perception. Our approach provides a framework for the readout of fine-tuned representations in the human brain and their subjective contents.},

title = {Temporary activation of long-term memory supports working memory},
abstract = {This study describes a functional magnetic resonance imaging study of humans engaged in long-term memory (LTM) and working memory tasks. A pattern classifier learned to identify patterns of brain activity associated with viewing and making judgments about three categories of pictures (famous people, famous locations, and common objects). The evaluation of these stimuli relied on perception and long-term semantic and/or episodic memories. We investigated whether this classifier could successfully decode brain activity from a subsequent delayed paired-associate recognition working memory task that required the short-term retention of the same stimuli. We reasoned that the LTM-trained classifier would be able to decode delay-period activity only if that activity reflected, to some extent, the temporary activation of LTM. Our results demonstrated successful decoding: delay-period activity from a distributed network of brain regions matched learned patterns of activity for task-relevant stimuli to a greater extent than for task-irrelevant stimuli. In varying degrees throughout the delay, activity reflected the target (a retrospective code) and its associate (a prospective code) with considerable variability among subjects. Although prefrontal cortex (PFC) demonstrated category-specific patterns of activity during the LTM task, these patterns were not reinstated in PFC during the working memory task. We conclude that the short-term retention of information can be supported by the temporary reactivation of LTM representations.},

abstract = {The existence of multiple parallel loops connecting sensorimotor systems to the basal ganglia has given rise to proposals that these nuclei serve as a selection mechanism resolving competitions between the alternative actions available in a given context. A strong test of this hypothesis is to require a computational model of the basal ganglia to generate integrated selection sequences in an autonomous agent, we therefore describe a robot architecture into which such a model is embedded, and require it to control action selection in a robotic task inspired by animal observations. Our results demonstrate effective action selection by the embedded model under a wide range of sensory and motivational conditions. When confronted with multiple, high salience alternatives, the robot also exhibits forms of behavioral disintegration that show similarities to animal behavior in conflict situations. The model is shown to cast light on recent neurobiological findings concerning behavioral switching and sequencing.},

abstract = {An event-related fMRI technique was used to assess neural responses to financial reward and penalty during a simple gambling task. We attempted to determine whether brain activities are dependent on the unique context of an event sequence. Thirty-six healthy volunteers participated in the study. The task was to guess the color of the suit of a card on each trial and to respond by pressing a button. Every correct response ("win") and incorrect response ("loss") was associated with financial reward and penalty, respectively. The magnitude of reward or penalty in each trial did not change; however, the subjects' self-reported emotional arousal was significantly higher for the events of "the fourth win of four wins in a row" and "the fourth loss of four losses in a row." We also found that the bilateral anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortices were specifically activated when the subjects experienced "the fourth win of four wins in a row" and "the fourth loss of four losses in a row." When the subjects experienced "a win following four losses in a row" or "a loss following four wins in a row," the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was specifically activated. Our data indicate that there exist brain activities associated with the event-sequence context in which abstract reward or penalty is received. These context-dependent activities appear to be crucial for adapting oneself to new circumstances and may account for clinical symptoms of various mental illnesses in which dysfunction of these regions has been reported.},

To this aim, we analyzed a previous published data set from a double-blind design combined with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings in which healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to one of three drug groups: amphetamine (an indirect DA agonist), haloperidol (DA D2 receptor antagonist), and placebo. Participants were exposed to an aversive classical conditioning paradigm using cutaneous electrical stimulation as the unconditioned stimulus (US), and visual cues as the conditioned stimuli (CS) where one colour (CS+) was followed by the US in 33% of the trials and another colour (CS-) had no consequences. All participants reported awareness of stimulus contingencies. Group analysis of fMRI data revealed that the left ventral striatum (VS) and amygdala activated in response to the CS+ in all the three groups. Because of their activation patterns and documented involvement in aversive conditioning, both regions were used as seeds in the functional connectivity analysis. To constrain the functional networks obtained to relate to the conditioned response, we also correlated seed activity with the Galvanic Skin Response (GSR). In the placebo group, the right ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra (VTA/SN), bilateral caudate, right parahippocampal gyrus, left inferior parietal lobule (IPL), bilateral postcentral gyrus, bilateral middle frontal (BA 46), orbitofrontal, and ventromedial prefrontal cortices (PFC, BA 10/11) correlated with the VS and amygdala seeds in response to the CS+ compared to the CS-. Enhancing dopamine transmission via amphetamine was associated with reduced task differences and significant functional connectivity for both CS+ and CS- conditions between the left VS seed and regions modulated by DA, such as the left VTA/SN, right caudate, left amygdala, left middle frontal gyrus (BA 46), and bilateral ventromedial PFC (BA 10). Blocking dopamine transmission via haloperidol was associated with significant functional connectivity across an alternate network of regions including the left amygdala seed and the right insula, the left ACC (BA 24/32), bilateral IPL (BA 40), precuneus (BA 7), post-central gyrus, middle frontal gyrus (BA 46), and supplementary motor area (SMA, BA 6) to the CS+ versus the CS-. These data provide insight into the distinct effects of DA agents on the functional connectivity between striatal, limbic, and prefrontal areas.},

title = {An automated labeling system for subdividing the human cerebral cortex on MRI scans into gyral based regions of interest},
abstract = {In this study, we have assessed the validity and reliability of an automated labeling system that we have developed for subdividing the human cerebral cortex on magnetic resonance images into gyral based regions of interest (ROIs). Using a dataset of 40 MRI scans we manually identified 34 cortical ROIs in each of the individual hemispheres. This information was then encoded in the form of an atlas that was utilized to automatically label ROIs. To examine the validity, as well as the intra- and inter-rater reliability of the automated system, we used both intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and a new method known as mean distance maps, to assess the degree of mismatch between the manual and the automated sets of ROIs. When compared with the manual ROIs, the automated ROIs were highly accurate, with an average ICC of 0.835 across all of the ROIs, and a mean distance error of less than 1 mm. Intra- and inter-rater comparisons yielded little to no difference between the sets of ROIs. These findings suggest that the automated method we have developed for subdividing the human cerebral cortex into standard gyral-based neuroanatomical regions is both anatomically valid and reliable. This method may be useful for both morphometric and functional studies of the cerebral cortex as well as for clinical investigations aimed at tracking the evolution of disease-induced changes over time, including clinical trials in which MRI-based measures are used to examine response to treatment.},

abstract = {The human brain is adept at anticipating upcoming events, but in a rapidly changing world, it is essential to detect and encode events that violate these expec- tancies. Unexpected events are more likely to be remembered than predictable events, but the under- lying neural mechanisms for these effects remain unclear. We report intracranial EEG recordings from the hippocampus of epilepsy patients, and from the nucleus accumbens of depression patients. We found that unexpected stimuli enhance an early (187 ms) and a late (482 ms) hippocampal potential, and that the late potential is associated with success- ful memory encoding for these stimuli. Recordings from the nucleus accumbens revealed a late potential (peak at 475 ms), which increases in magnitude during unexpected items, but no subsequent memory effect and no early component. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that activity in a loop involving the hippocampus and the nucleus accum- bens promotes encoding of unexpected events.},

abstract = {Here we review recent functional neuroimaging, neuropsychological and behavioral studies examining the role of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and the caudate in learning visual categories either by verbalizeable rules or without awareness. The MTL and caudate are found to play dissociable roles in different types of category learning with successful rule-based (RB) categorization depending selectively on the MTL and non-verbalizeable information-integration (II) category learning depending on the posterior caudate. These studies utilize a combination of experimental cognitive psychology, mathematical modeling (Decision Bound Theory (DBT)) and cognitive computational modeling (the COVIS model of Ashby et al. [1998. A neuropsychological theory of multiple systems in category learning. Psychological Review 105, 442-481]) to enhance the understanding of data obtained via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The combination of approaches is used to both test hypotheses of the cognitive model and also to incorporate hypotheses about the strategies used by participants to direct analysis of fMRI data. Examination of the roles of the MTL and caudate in visual category learning holds the promise of bridging between abstract cognitive models of behavior, systems neuroscience, neuropsychology, and the underlying neurophysiology of these brain regions.},

title = {Measuring interregional functional connectivity using coherence and partial coherence analyses of fMRI data},
abstract = {Understanding functional connectivity within the brain is crucial to understanding neural function; even the simplest cognitive operations are supported by highly distributed neural circuits. We developed a novel method to measure task-related functional interactions between neural regions by applying coherence and partial coherence analyses to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Coherence and partial coherence are spectral measures that estimate the linear time-invariant (LTI) relationship between time series. They can be used to generate maps of task-specific connectivity associated with seed regions of interest (ROIs). These maps may then be compared across tasks, revealing nodes with task-related changes of connectivity to the seed ROI. To validate the method, we applied it to an event-related fMRI data set acquired while subjects performed two sequence tapping tasks, one of which required more bimanual coordination. Areas showing increased functional connectivity with both tasks were the same as those showing increased activity. Furthermore, though there were no significant differences in mean activity between the two tasks, significant increases in interhemispheric coherence were found between the primary motor (M1) and premotor (PM) regions for the task requiring more bimanual coordination. This increase in interhemispheric connectivity is supported by other brain imaging techniques as well as patient studies.},

Its very ubiquity suggests that spontaneous recovery has multiple sources.},

abstract = {The dorsal raphe nucleus and its serotonin-releasing neurons are thought to regulate motivation and reward-seeking. These neurons are known to be active during motivated behavior, but the underlying principles that govern their activity are unknown. Here we show that a group of dorsal raphe neurons encode behavioral tasks in a systematic manner, tracking progress toward upcoming rewards. We analyzed dorsal raphe neuron activity recorded while animals performed two reward-oriented saccade tasks. There was a strong correlation between the tonic activity level of a neuron during behavioral tasks and its encoding of reward-related cues and outcomes. Neurons that were tonically excited during the task predominantly carried positive reward signals. Neurons that were tonically inhibited during the task predominantly carried negative reward signals. Neurons that did not change their tonic activity levels during the task had weak reward signals with no tendency for a positive or negative direction. This form of correlated task and reward coding accounted for the majority of systematic variation in dorsal raphe response patterns in our tasks. A smaller component of neural activity reflected detection of reward delivery. Our data suggest that the dorsal raphe nucleus encodes participation in a behavioral task in terms of its future motivational outcomes.},

title = {Reinforcement learning of motor skills with policy gradients},
abstract = {Autonomous learning is one of the hallmarks of human and animal behavior, and understanding the principles of learning will be crucial in order to achieve true autonomy in advanced machines like humanoid robots. In this paper, we examine learning of complex motor skills with human-like limbs. While supervised learning can offer useful tools for bootstrapping behavior, e.g., by learning from demonstration, it is only reinforcement learning that offers a general approach to the final trial-and-error improvement that is needed by each individual acquiring a skill. Neither neurobiological nor machine learning studies have, so far, offered compelling results on how reinforcement learning can be scaled to the high-dimensional continuous state and action spaces of humans or humanoids. Here, we combine two recent research developments on learning motor control in order to achieve this scaling. First, we interpret the idea of modular motor control by means of motor primitives as a suitable way to generate parameterized control policies for reinforcement learning. Second, we combine motor primitives with the theory of stochastic policy gradient learning, which currently seems to be the only feasible framework for reinforcement learning for humanoids. We evaluate different policy gradient methods with a focus on their applicability to parameterized motor primitives. We compare these algorithms in the context of motor primitive learning, and show that our most modern algorithm, the Episodic Natural Actor-Critic outperforms previous algorithms by at least an order of magnitude. We demonstrate the efficiency of this reinforcement learning method in the application of learning to hit a baseball with an anthropomorphic robot arm.},

abstract = {Experimental designs for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments can be characterized by their estimation efficiency, which is a measure of the variance in the estimate of the hemodynamic response function (HRF), and their detection power, which is a measure of the variance in the estimate of the amplitude of functional activity. Previous studies have shown that there exists a fundamental trade-off between efficiency and power for experiments with a single trial type of interest. This paper extends the prior work by presenting a theoretical model for the relation between detection power and estimation efficiency in experiments with multiple trial types. It is shown that the trade-off between efficiency and power present in multiple-trial-type experiments is identical in form to that observed for single-trial-type experiments. Departures from the predicted trade-off due to the inclusion of basis function expansions and the assumption of correlated noise are examined. Finally, conditional entropy is introduced as measure for the randomness of a design, and an empirical relation between entropy and estimation efficiency is presented.},

Patients with Parkinson's disease, who have depleted dopamine in the basal ganglia, are impaired in tasks that require learning from trial and error. Here, we show, using two cognitive procedural learning tasks, that Parkinson's patients off medication are better at learning to avoid choices that lead to negative outcomes than they are at learning from positive outcomes. Dopamine medication reverses this bias, making patients more sensitive to positive than negative outcomes. This pattern was predicted by our biologically based computational model of basal ganglia-dopamine interactions in cognition, which has separate pathways for "Go" and "NoGo" responses that are differentially modulated by positive and negative reinforcement.},

title = {Dopamine and reward: the anhedonia hypothesis 30 years on},
abstract = {The anhedonia hypothesis--that brain dopamine plays a critical role in the subjective pleasure associated with positive rewards--was intended to draw the attention of psychiatrists to the growing evidence that dopamine plays a critical role in the objective reinforcement and incentive motivation associated with food and water, brain stimulation reward, and psychomotor stimulant and opiate reward. The hypothesis called to attention the apparent paradox that neuroleptics, drugs used to treat a condition involving anhedonia (schizophrenia), attenuated in laboratory animals the positive reinforcement that we normally associate with pleasure. The hypothesis held only brief interest for psychiatrists, who pointed out that the animal studies reflected acute actions of neuroleptics whereas the treatment of schizophrenia appears to result from neuroadaptations to chronic neuroleptic administration, and that it is the positive symptoms of schizophrenia that neuroleptics alleviate, rather than the negative symptoms that include anhedonia. Perhaps for these reasons, the hypothesis has had minimal impact in the psychiatric literature. Despite its limited heuristic value for the understanding of schizophrenia, however, the anhedonia hypothesis has had major impact on biological theories of reinforcement, motivation, and addiction. Brain dopamine plays a very important role in reinforcement of response habits, conditioned preferences, and synaptic plasticity in cellular models of learning and memory. The notion that dopamine plays a dominant role in reinforcement is fundamental to the psychomotor stimulant theory of addiction, to most neuroadaptation theories of addiction, and to current theories of conditioned reinforcement and reward prediction. Properly understood, it is also fundamental to recent theories of incentive motivation.},

title = {Dopamine, prediction error and associative learning: a model-based account},
abstract = {The notion of prediction error has established itself at the heart of formal models of animal learning and current hypotheses of dopamine function. Several interpretations of prediction error have been offered, including the model-free reinforcement learning method known as temporal difference learning (TD), and the important Rescorla-Wagner (RW) learning rule. Here, we present a model-based adaptation of these ideas that provides a good account of empirical data pertaining to dopamine neuron firing patterns and associative learning paradigms such as latent inhibition, Kamin blocking and overshadowing. Our departure from model-free reinforcement learning also offers: 1) a parsimonious distinction between tonic and phasic dopamine functions; 2) a potential generalization of the role of phasic dopamine from valence-dependent "reward" processing to valence-independent "salience" processing; 3) an explanation for the selectivity of certain dopamine manipulations on motivation for distal rewards; and 4) a plausible link between formal notions of prediction error and accounts of disturbances of thought in schizophrenia (in which dopamine dysfunction is strongly implicated). The model distinguishes itself from existing accounts by offering novel predictions pertaining to the firing of dopamine neurons in various untested behavioral scenarios.},

title = {Glutamate in dopamine neurons: Synaptic versus diffuse transmission},
abstract = {There is solid electron microscopic data demonstrating the existence of dopamine (DA) axon terminals (varicosities) with or without synaptic membrane specializations (junctional complexes) in many parts of the CNS, and notably in neostriatum and nucleus accumbens. The dual morphological character of these DA innervations has led to the suggestion that the meso-telencephalic DA system operates by diffuse (or volume) as well as by classical synaptic transmission. In the last decade, electrophysiological and neurochemical evidence has also accumulated indicating that monoamine neurons in various parts of the CNS, and particularly the mesencephalic DA neurons, might release glutamate as a co-transmitter. Following the identification of the vesicular transporters for glutamate (VGluT), in situ hybridization and RT-PCR studies carried out on isolated neurons or standard tissue cultures, and more recently in vivo, have shown that VGluT2 mRNA may be expressed in a significant proportion of mesencephalic DA neurons, at least in the ventral tegmental area. A current study also suggests that the co-expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and VGluT2 by these neurons is regulated during embryonic development, and may be derepressed or reactivated postnatally following their partial destruction by neonatal administration of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). In both 15 day-old and adult rats subjected or not to the neonatal 6-OHDA lesion, concurrent electron microscopic examination of the nucleus accumbens after dual immunocytochemical labeling for TH and VGluT2 reveals the co-existence of the two proteins in a significant proportion of these axon terminals. Moreover, all TH varicosities which co-localize VGluT2 are synaptic, as if there was a link between the potential of DA axon terminals to release glutamate and their establishment of synaptic junctions. Together with the RT-PCR and in situ hybridization data demonstrating the co-localization of TH and VGluT2 mRNA in mesencephalic neurons of the VTA, these observations raise a number of fundamental questions regarding the functioning of the meso-telencephalic DA system in healthy or diseased brain.},

abstract = {Mesencephalic dopaminergic system (MDS) neurons may participate in learning by providing a prediction error signal to their targets, which include ventral striatal, orbital, and medial frontal regions, as well as by showing sensitivity to the degree of uncertainty associated with individual stimuli. We investigated the mechanisms of probabilistic classification learning in humans using functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the effects of feedback and uncertainty. The design was optimized for separating neural responses to stimulus, delay, and negative and positive feedback components. Compared with fixation, stimulus and feedback activated brain regions consistent with the MDS, whereas the delay period did not. Midbrain activity was significantly different for negative versus positive feedback (consistent with coding of the "prediction error") and was reliably correlated with the degree of uncertainty as well as with activity in MDS target regions. Purely cognitive feedback apparently engages the same regions as rewarding stimuli, consistent with a broader characterization of this network.},

title = {Cortico-basal ganglia mechanisms for overcoming innate, habitual and motivational behaviors},
abstract = {Most of the human behaviors are executed automatically under familiar circumstances. These behaviors are prepotent in that they take precedence over any other potential alternatives. Yet, humans are also capable of engaging cognitive resources to inhibit such a prepotent behavior and replace it with an alternative controlled behavior in response to an unforeseen situation. This remarkable capability to switch behaviors in a short period of time is the hallmark of executive functions. In this article, we first argue that the prepotent automaticity could emerge at least in three different domains - innate, habitual and motivational. We then review neurophysiological findings on how the brain might realize its switching functions in each domain, primarily by focusing on the monkey oculomotor system as the experimental model. Emerging evidence now suggests that multiple neuronal populations in the shared cortico-basal ganglia network contribute to overriding prepotent eye movement, be its origin innate, habitual or motivational. This consideration suggests the general versatility of the cortico-basal ganglia network as the neural mechanism whereby humans and other animals keep themselves from becoming subservient to reflex, habit and motivational impulses.},

title = {Striatum and pre-SMA facilitate decision-making under time pressure},
abstract = {Human decision-making almost always takes place under time pressure. When people are engaged in activities such as shopping, driving, or playing chess, they have to continually balance the demands for fast decisions against the demands for accurate decisions. In the cognitive sciences, this balance is thought to be modulated by a response threshold, the neural substrate of which is currently subject to speculation. In a speed decision-making experiment, we presented participants with cues that indicated different requirements for response speed. Application of a mathematical model for the behavioral data confirmed that cueing for speed lowered the response threshold. Functional neuroimaging showed that cueing for speed activates the striatum and the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), brain structures that are part of a closed-loop motor circuit involved in the preparation of voluntary action plans. Moreover, activation in the striatum is known to release the motor system from global inhibition, thereby facilitating faster but possibly premature actions. Finally, the data show that individual variation in the activation of striatum and pre-SMA is selectively associated with individual variation in the amplitude of the adjustments in the response threshold estimated by the mathematical model. These results demonstrate that when people have to make decisions under time pressure their striatum and pre-SMA show increased levels of activation.},

title = {Analyzing functional connectivity using a network likelihood model of ensemble neural spiking activity},
abstract = {Analyzing the dependencies between spike trains is an important step in understanding how neurons work in concert to represent biological signals. Usually this is done for pairs of neurons at a time using correlation-based techniques. Chornoboy, Schramm, and Karr (1988) proposed maximum likelihood methods for the simultaneous analysis of multiple pair-wise interactions among an ensemble of neurons. One of these methods is an iterative, continuous-time estimation algorithm for a network likelihood model formulated in terms of multiplicative conditional intensity functions. We devised a discrete-time version of this algorithm that includes a new, efficient computational strategy, a principled method to compute starting values, and a principled stopping criterion. In an analysis of simulated neural spike trains from ensembles of interacting neurons, the algorithm recovered the correct connectivity matrices and interaction parameters. In the analysis of spike trains from an ensemble of rat hippocampal place cells, the algorithm identified a connectivity matrix and interaction parameters consistent with the pattern of conjoined firing predicted by the overlap of the neurons' spatial receptive fields. These results suggest that the network likelihood model can be an efficient tool for the analysis of ensemble spiking activity.},

Dopamine plays an important role in both the ability to energize feeding and to reinforce food-seeking behaviour; the role in energizing feeding is secondary to the prerequisite role in reinforcement. Dopaminergic activation is triggered by the auditory and visual as well as the tactile, olfactory, and gustatory stimuli of foods. While dopamine plays a central role in the feeding and food-seeking of normal animals, some food rewarded learning can be seen in genetically engineered dopamine-deficient mice.},

abstract = {Subcortical loops through the basal ganglia and the cerebellum form computationally powerful distributed processing modules (DPMs). This paper relates the computational features of a DPM's loop through the basal ganglia to experimental results for two kinds of natural action selection. First, functional imaging during a serial order recall task was used to study human brain activity during the selection of sequential actions from working memory. Second, microelectrode recordings from monkeys trained in a step-tracking task were used to study the natural selection of corrective submovements. Our DPM-based model assisted in the interpretation of puzzling data from both of these experiments. We come to posit that the many loops through the basal ganglia each regulate the embodiment of pattern formation in a given area of cerebral cortex. This operation serves to instantiate different kinds of action (or thought) mediated by different areas of cerebral cortex. We then use our findings to formulate a model of the aetiology of schizophrenia.},

abstract = {Studies of the medial temporal lobe and basal ganglia memory systems have recently been extended towards understanding the neural systems contributing to category learning. The basal ganglia, in particular, have been linked to probabilistic category learning in humans. A separate parallel literature in systems neuroscience has emerged, indicating a role for the basal ganglia and related dopamine inputs in reward prediction and feedback processing. Here, we review behavioral, neuropsychological, functional neuroimaging, and computational studies of basal ganglia and dopamine contributions to learning in humans. Collectively, these studies implicate the basal ganglia in incremental, feedback-based learning that involves integrating information across multiple experiences. The medial temporal lobes, by contrast, contribute to rapid encoding of relations between stimuli and support flexible generalization of learning to novel contexts and stimuli. By breaking down our understanding of the cognitive and neural mechanisms contributing to different aspects of learning, recent studies are providing insight into how, and when, these different processes support learning, how they may interact with each other, and the consequence of different forms of learning for the representation of knowledge.},

Orbitofrontal cortex is involved in coding stimulus reward value and in concert with the amygdala and ventral striatum is implicated in representing predicted future reward. Such representations can be used to guide action selection for reward, a process that depends, at least in part, on orbital and medial prefrontal cortex as well as dorsal striatum.},

title = {EEG dynamics of the frontoparietal network during reaching preparation in humans},
abstract = {Visuomotor transformation processes are essential when accurate reaching movements towards a visual target have to be performed. In contrast, those transformations are not needed for similar, but non-visually guided, arm movements. According to previous studies, these transformations are carried out by neuronal populations located in the parietal and frontal cortical areas (the so-called "dorsal visual stream"). However, it is still debated whether these processes are mediated by the sequential and/or parallel activation of the frontoparietal areas. To investigate this issue, we designed a task where the same visual cue could represent either the target of a reaching/pointing movement or the go-signal for a similar but non-targeting arm movement. By subtracting the event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded from healthy subjects performing the two conditions, we identified the brain processes underlying the visuomotor transformations needed for accurate reaching/pointing movements. We then localized the generators by means of cortical current density (CCD) reconstruction and studied their dynamics from visual cue presentation to movement onset. The results showed simultaneous activation of the parietal and frontal areas from 140 to 260 ms. The results are interpreted as neural correlates of two critical phases of visuomotor integration, namely target selection and movement selection. Our findings suggest that the visuomotor transformation processes required for correct reaching/pointing movements do not rely on a purely sequential activation of the frontoparietal areas, but mainly on a parallel information processing system, where feedback circuits play an important role before movement onset.},

abstract = {Individuals use the outcomes of their actions to adjust future behavior. However, it remains unclear whether the same neural circuits are used to adjust behavior due to rewarding and punishing outcomes. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a reward-providing reaction time task to investigate the adaptation of a simple motor response following four different outcomes (delivery versus omission and monetary gain versus loss). We found that activation in the thalamus and insula predicted adjustments of motor responses due to outcomes that were cued and delivered, whereas activation in the ventral striatum predicted such adjustments when outcomes were cued but omitted. Further, activation of OFC predicted improvement after all punishing outcomes, independent of whether they were omitted rewards or delivered punishments. Finally, we found that activity in anterior cingulate predicted adjustment after delivered punishments and activity in dorsal striatum predicted adaptation after delivered rewards. Our results provide evidence that different but somewhat overlapping circuits mediate the same behavioral adaptation when it is driven by different incentive outcomes.},

title = {Modifications of reward expectation-related neuronal activity during learning in primate striatum},
abstract = {This study investigated neuronal activity in the anterior striatum while monkeys repeatedly learned to associate new instruction stimuli with known behavioral reactions and reinforcers. In a delayed go-nogo task with several trial types, an initial picture instructed the animal to execute or withhold a reaching movement and to expect a liquid reward or not. During learning, new instruction pictures were presented, and animals guessed and performed one of the trial types according to a trial-and-error strategy. Learning of a large number of pictures resulted in a learning set in which learning took place in a few trials and correct performance exceeded 80% in the first 60-90 trials. About 200 task-related striatal neurons studied in both familiar and learning conditions showed three forms of changes during learning. Activations related to the preparation and execution of behavioral reactions and the expectation of reward were maintained in many neurons but occurred in inappropriate trial types when behavioral errors were made. The activations became appropriate for individual trial types when the animals' behavior adapted to the new task contingencies. In particular, reward expectation-related activations occurred initially in both rewarded and unrewarded movement trials and became subsequently restricted to rewarded trials. These changes occurred in parallel with the visible adaptation of reward expectations by the animals. The second learning change consisted in decreases of task-related activations that were either restricted to the initial trials of new learning problems or persisted during the subsequent consolidation phase. They probably reflected reductions in the expectation and preparation of upcoming task events, including reward. The third learning change consisted in transient or sustained increases of activations. These might reflect the increased attention accompanying learning and serve to induce synaptic changes underlying the behavioral adaptations. Both decreases and increases often induced changes in the trial selective occurrence of activations. In conclusion, neurons in anterior striatum showed changes related to adaptations or reductions of expectations in new task situations and displayed activations that might serve to induce structural changes during learning.},

title = {Network analysis of single-subject fMRI during a finger opposition task},
abstract = {The analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data has typically relied on univariate methods to identify areas of brain activity related to cognitive and behavioral task performance. We investigated the ability of multivariate network analysis using a modified form of principal component analysis, the Scaled Subprofile Model (SSM), applied to single-subject fMRI data to identify patterns of interactions among brain regions over time during an anatomically well-characterized simple motor task. We hypothesized that each subject would exhibit correlated patterns of brain activation in several regions known to participate in the regulation of movement including the contralateral motor cortex and the ipsilateral cerebellum. EPI BOLD images were acquired in six healthy participants as they performed a visually and auditorally paced finger opposition task. SSM analysis was applied to the fMR time series on a single-subject basis. Linear combinations of the major principal components that predicted the expected hemodynamic response to the order of experimental conditions were identified for each participant. These combinations of SSM patterns were highly associated with the expected hemodynamic response, an indicator of local neuronal activity, in each participant (0.84 </= R(2) </= 0.97, all P's < 0.0001). As predicted, the combined pattern in each subject was characterized most prominently by relatively increased activations in contralateral sensorimotor cortex and ipsilateral cerebellum. Additionally, all subjects showed areas of relatively decreased activation in the ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex and contralateral cerebellum. The application of network analysis methods, such as SSM, to single-subject fMRI data can identify patterns of task-specific, functionally interacting brain areas in individual subjects. This approach may help identify individual differences in the task-related functional connectivity, track changes in task-related patterns of activity within or between fMRI sessions, and provide a method to identify individual differences in response to treatment.},

The cellular mechanisms of memory are thought to include a number that produce long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD) of synaptic strength. Our work presents evidence that LTP and LTD occur simultaneously at memory-relevant synapses. We report here that low frequency stimulation generates NMDA receptor-dependent LTD in Wistar rat superficial (layers II and III), and LTP in the deep entorhinal cortex layers (layers V and VI). LTP in deep layers is masked by simultaneously occurring voltage-gated calcium channel-dependent LTD. Our data support a novel mechanism for the sliding-threshold (BCM) model of synaptic plasticity: The sliding thresholds for induction of LTP and LTD in entorhinal cortex deep layers will be driven by the relative activation state of NMDA receptors and voltage-gated calcium channels. The co-expression of LTD and LTP at presynaptic sites in the entorhinal cortex deep layers reveals an intriguing mechanism for differential processing of synaptic information, which may underlie the vast dynamic capacity for information storage by this cortical structure.},

title = {Reward processing in primate orbitofrontal cortex and basal ganglia},
abstract = {This article reviews and interprets neuronal activities related to the expectation and delivery of reward in the primate orbitofrontal cortex, in comparison with slowly discharging neurons in the striatum (caudate, putamen and ventral striatum, including nucleus accumbens) and midbrain dopamine neurons. Orbitofrontal neurons showed three principal forms of reward-related activity during the performance of delayed response tasks, namely responses to reward-predicting instructions, activations during the expectation period immediately preceding reward and responses following reward. These activations discriminated between different rewards, often on the basis of the animals' preferences. Neurons in the striatum were also activated in relation to the expectation and detection of reward but in addition showed activities related to the preparation, initiation and execution of movements which reflected the expected reward. Dopamine neurons responded to rewards and reward-predicting stimuli, and coded an error in the prediction of reward. Thus, the investigated cortical and basal ganglia structures showed multiple, heterogeneous, partly simultaneous activations which were related to specific aspects of rewards. These activations may represent the neuronal substrates of rewards during learning and established behavioral performance. The processing of reward expectations suggests an access to central representations of rewards which may be used for the neuronal control of goaldirected behavior.},

title = {Deciding advantageously before knowing the advantageous strategy},
abstract = {Deciding advantageously in a complex situation is thought to require overt reasoning on declarative knowledge, namely, on facts pertaining to premises, options for action, and outcomes of actions that embody the pertinent previous experience. An alternative possibility was investigated: that overt reasoning is preceded by a nonconscious biasing step that uses neural systems other than those that support declarative knowledge. Normal participants and patients with prefrontal damage and decision-making defects performed a gambling task in which behavioral, psychophysiological, and self-account measures were obtained in parallel. Normals began to choose advantageously before they realized which strategy worked best, whereas prefrontal patients continued to choose disadvantageously even after they knew the correct strategy. Moreover, normals began to generate anticipatory skin conductance responses (SCRs) whenever they pondered a choice that turned out to be risky, before they knew explicitly that it was a risky choice, whereas patients never developed anticipatory SCRs, although some eventually realized which choices were risky. The results suggest that, in normal individuals, nonconscious biases guide behavior before conscious knowledge does. Without the help of such biases, overt knowledge may be insufficient to ensure advantageous behavior.},

The specific shape of these responses is of some importance to the design and analysis of blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments. Using fMRI scanning, we examine here the characteristics and variability of hemodynamic responses from the central sulcus in human subjects during an event-related, simple reaction time task. Specifically, we determine the contribution of subject, day, and scanning session (within a day) to variability in the shape of evoked hemodynamic response. We find that while there is significant and substantial variability in the shape of responses collected across subjects, responses collected during multiple scans within a single subject are less variable. The results are discussed in terms of the impact of response variability upon sensitivity and specificity of analyses of event-related fMRI designs.},

Recent advances in the spatial and temporal resolution of brain imaging techniques enable investigators to visualize changes in neural activation before financial decisions.

Accumulating evidence also suggests that antecedent neural activation in these regions can be used to predict upcoming financial decisions. These findings have implications for predicting choices and for building a physiologically constrained theory of decision-making.},

abstract = {To examine functional roles of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in visuomotor association learning, neuronal activity in the mPFC of a behaving monkey was recorded during this learning. The monkey was presented a cueing visual stimulus, and required to push, pull or turn a manipulator according to the cue following a delay period. Under the control condition, three cues (circle, triangle and square) instructed the monkey to the three responses in a block of trials. After 2 months of training the animal was familiar with these cue-response associations. Under the learning condition, two of the three familiar cues and one novel cue were presented in a block. The monkey initially did not know what the novel cue instructed at first and learned a new cue-response association by trial and error. Neurons in the mPFC showed marked responses to cue presentation, and cue responses changed depending on whether cues were familiar or novel. A group of mPFC neurons responded to novel cues, but not to familiar cues. Another group of neurons responded to familiar cues, but not to novel cues. In a subgroup of these familiar cue-selective neurons, cue response was increased under the learning condition compared to the control condition. These results suggest that mPFC neurons differentiate between familiar and novel instructions, and that the neurons responsive to familiar stimuli enhance their modulations when both familiar and novel instructions have to be processed during task performance.},

title = {Embedding reward signals into perception and cognition},
abstract = {Despite considerable interest in the neural basis of valuation, the question of how valuation affects cognitive processing has received relatively less attention. Here, we review evidence from recent behavioral and neuroimaging studies supporting the notion that motivation can enhance perceptual and executive control processes to achieve more efficient goal-directed behavior. Specifically, in the context of cognitive tasks offering monetary gains, improved behavioral performance has been repeatedly observed in conjunction with elevated neural activations in task-relevant perceptual, cognitive and reward-related regions. We address the neural basis of motivation-cognition interactions by suggesting various modes of communication between relevant neural networks: (1) global hub regions may integrate information from multiple inputs providing a communicative link between specialized networks; (2) point-to-point interactions allow for more specific cross-network communication; and (3) diffuse neuromodulatory systems can relay motivational signals to cortex and enhance signal processing. Together, these modes of communication allow information regarding motivational significance to reach relevant brain regions and shape behavior.},

title = {An introduction to causal inference},
abstract = {This paper summarizes recent advances in causal inference and underscores the paradigmatic shifts that must be undertaken in moving from traditional statistical analysis to causal analysis of multivariate data. Special emphasis is placed on the assumptions that underlie all causal inferences, the languages used in formulating those assumptions, the conditional nature of all causal and counterfactual claims, and the methods that have been developed for the assessment of such claims. These advances are illustrated using a general theory of causation based on the Structural Causal Model (SCM) described in Pearl (2000a), which subsumes and unifies other approaches to causation, and provides a coherent mathematical foundation for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper surveys the development of mathematical tools for inferring (from a combination of data and assumptions) answers to three types of causal queries: those about (1) the effects of potential interventions, (2) probabilities of counterfactuals, and (3) direct and indirect effects (also known as "mediation"). Finally, the paper defines the formal and conceptual relationships between the structural and potential-outcome frameworks and presents tools for a symbiotic analysis that uses the strong features of both. The tools are demonstrated in the analyses of mediation, causes of effects, and probabilities of causation.},

title = {Influence of reward expectation on behavior-related neuronal activity in primate striatum},
abstract = {Rewards constitute important goals for voluntary behavior. This study aimed to investigate how expected rewards influence behavior-related neuronal activity in the anterior striatum. In a delayed go-nogo task, monkeys executed or withheld a reaching movement and obtained liquid or sound as reinforcement. An initial instruction picture indicated the behavioral reaction to be performed and the reinforcer to be obtained after a subsequent trigger stimulus. Movements varied according to the reinforcers predicted by the instructions, suggesting that animals differentially expected the two outcomes. About 250 of nearly 1,500 neurons in anterior parts of caudate nucleus, putamen, and ventral striatum showed typical task-related activations that reflected the expectation of instructions and trigger, and the preparation, initiation, and execution of behavioral reactions. Strikingly, most task-related activations occurred only when liquid reward was delivered at trial end, rather than the reinforcing sound. Activations close to the time of reward showed similar preferences for liquid reward over the reinforcing sound, suggesting a relationship to the expectation or detection of the motivational outcome of the trial rather than to a "correct" or "end-of-trial" signal. By contrast, relatively few activations in the present task occurred irrespective of the type of reinforcement. In conclusion, many of the behavior-related neurons investigated in the anterior striatum were influenced by an upcoming primary liquid reward and did not appear to code behavioral acts in a motivationally neutral manner. Rather, these neurons incorporated information about the expected outcome into their behavior-related activity. The activations influenced by reward several seconds before its occurrence may constitute a neuronal basis for the retrograde effects of rewards on behavioral reactions.},

abstract = {Can decisions be predicted from brain activity? It is frequently difficult in neuroimaging studies to determine this, because it is not easy to establish when the decision has been taken. In a rigorous approach to this issue, we show that in a neurally plausible integrate-and-fire attractor-based model of decision-making, the noise generated by the randomness in the spiking times of neurons can be used to predict a decision for 0.5 s or more before the decision cues are applied. The ongoing noise at the time the decision cues are applied influences which decision will be taken. It is possible to predict on a single trial to more than 68% correct which of two decisions will be taken. The prediction is made from the spontaneous firing before the decision cues are applied in the two populations of neurons that represent the decisions. Thus decisions can be partly predicted even before the decision cues are applied, due to noise in the decision-making process. This analysis has interesting implications for decision-making and free will, for it shows that random neuronal firing times can influence a decision before the evidence for the decision has been provided.},

title = {The impact of temporal regularization on estimates of the BOLD hemodynamic response function: a comparative analysis},
abstract = {In fMRI data analysis it has been shown that for a wide range of situations the hemodynamic response function (HRF) can be reasonably characterized as the impulse response function of a linear and time invariant system. An accurate and robust extraction of the HRF is essential to infer quantitative information about the relative timing of the neuronal events in different brain regions. When no assumptions are made about the HRF shape, it is most commonly estimated using time windowed averaging or a least squares estimated general linear model based on either Fourier or delta basis functions. Recently, regularization methods have been employed to increase the estimation efficiency of the HRF; typically these methods produce more accurate HRF estimates than the least squares approach [Goutte, C., Nielsen, F.A., Hansen, L.K., 2000. Modeling the Haemodynamic Response in fMRI Using Smooth FIR Filters. IEEE Trans. Med. Imag. 19(12), 1188-1201.]. Here, we use simulations to clarify the relative merit of temporal regularization based methods compared to the least squares methods with respect to the accuracy of estimating certain characteristics of the HRF such as time to peak (TTP), height (HR) and width (W) of the response. We implemented a Bayesian approach proposed by Marrelec et al. [Marrelec, G., Benali, H., Ciuciu, P., Pelegrini-Issac, M., Poline, J.-B., 2003. Robust Estimation of the Hemodynamic Response Function in Event-Related BOLD fMRI Using Basic Physiological Information. Hum. Brain Mapp. 19, 1-17., Marrelec, G., Benali, H., Ciuciu, P., Poline, J.B. Bayesian estimation of the hemodynamic of the hemodynamic response function in functional MRI. In: R. F, editor; 2001; Melville. p 229-247.] and its deterministic counterpart based on a combination of Tikhonov regularization [Tikhonov, A.N., Arsenin, V.Y., 1977. Solution of ill-posed problems. Washington DC: W.H. Winston.] and generalized cross-validation (GCV) [Wahba, G., 1990. Spline Models for Observational Data. Philadelphia: SIAM.] for selecting the regularization parameter. The performance of both methods is compared with least square estimates as a function of temporal resolution, color and strength of the noise, and the type of stimulus sequences used. In almost all situations, under the considered assumptions (e.g. linearity, time invariance and smooth HRF), the regularization-based techniques more accurately characterize the HRF compared to the least-squares method. Our results clarify the effects of temporal resolution, noise color, and experimental design on the accuracy of HRF estimation.},

title = {Correlated coding of motivation and outcome of decision by dopamine neurons},
abstract = {We recorded the activity of midbrain dopamine neurons in an instrumental conditioning task in which monkeys made a series of behavioral decisions on the basis of distinct reward expectations. Dopamine neurons responded to the first visual cue that appeared in each trial [conditioned stimulus (CS)] through which monkeys initiated trial for decision while expecting trial-specific reward probability and volume. The magnitude of neuronal responses to the CS was approximately proportional to reward expectations but with considerable discrepancy. In contrast, CS responses appear to represent motivational properties, because their magnitude at trials with identical reward expectation had significant negative correlation with reaction times of the animal after the CS. Dopamine neurons also responded to reinforcers that occurred after behavioral decisions, and the responses precisely encoded positive and negative reward expectation errors (REEs). The gain of coding REEs by spike frequency increased during learning act-outcome contingencies through a few months of task training, whereas coding of motivational properties remained consistent during the learning. We found that the magnitude of CS responses was positively correlated with that of reinforcers, suggesting a modulation of the effectiveness of REEs as a teaching signal by motivation. For instance, rate of learning could be faster when animals are motivated, whereas it could be slower when less motivated, even at identical REEs. Therefore, the dual correlated coding of motivation and REEs suggested the involvement of the dopamine system, both in reinforcement in more elaborate ways than currently proposed and in motivational function in reward-based decision-making and learning.},
