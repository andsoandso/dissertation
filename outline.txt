    * SubSub: The rise of reward prediction
        - DA and reinforcement have a long relation...
        - It is not anhedonia afterall; what was anhedonia?
        - Expectations matter.
    * SubSub: Defining RPE: RL computations
        - Really simple: Rescorla-Wagner.
        - No unification as yet for these many other algoritmns; There is an 
        ad hoc agreement only.
    * SubSub: Criticisms of the RPE
    * SubSub: Physiologic basis of RPE
        - Habenula
        - SC
