            "And while mapping these kinds of categories to neural activity is underway \cite{Ashby:2005p9152,Ashby:2006p9153} there as yet no obvious way to interlace my hypothesis of rewarding categories with their putative category learning systems and to the many models of categoziation touched on in the introduction, I'll take a simpler route based solely on Shepards finding.  Whatevet the representation and/or category learning system that implments rewardi categories, they show an exponnetial (or gaussian) decline with similartiy."
