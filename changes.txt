# Requested Changes:
0. [DONE -- everywhere] Third person impersonal.
1. [DONE -- everywhere] Chuck and Carol's line edits.
2. [DONE -- near p15, in 'Not cortex, colliculus.'] Weaken Dommett el al's 100 ms argument.
3. [SKIPPED -- I (tried) to make it clear in the abstract, intro (near p26) and disscussion (first paragraph) that the stimulus-response part of the task is not and cannot be a higher-order conditioning paradigm, as such I feel a review of higher order condtioning would just confuse that point.] Review higher-order conditioning in the Introduction.
4. [DONE -- near p5, last paragraph before 'Classics, Expectations, and Tissues'] Link long DA discussion in intro to the rest, and clarify what I mean by DA (i.e. phasic DA from VTA/SNc _only_), also improve abstract to reflect these changes.
5. [DONE -- near p32 in 'Well behaved results' and 92 second paragraph in 'Taking Us to Can'] Citations for behavior.
6. [DONE -- near p63, second paragraph in 'F-them.'] Include/mention simulation results so that people see why the significance tests are all significant and why ranking is a better approach.
7. [DONE -- near p26, in 'Why Are We Here Again?'] Make plain that the model tests the implicit assumption about what is happening cognitively, i.e. inference necessity.
8. [DONE -- near p29] Map of methods at the start of the methods section, high level description.
9. [DONE -- near p26 in 'Why Are We Here Again?'] At end of intro Chuck wants a summary of why the work matters, the most significant result(s).
10. [DONE -- near p51] Create a map (at the start) of Chap 3 as well.
11. In the discussion link the intro to it, then make the significance of the work crystal clear.  The most interesting extension is that is rewards are categoires, like and category they should/may be constructable arbitrarily free from any primary relation.
12. [DONE -- near p39] Equation fixes from Chuck.
13. [DONE -- near p4, first paragraph of the Introduction] Make reward definitions very clear, right from the start (do this before 3.).
14. Rework discussion as discussed with Chuck, review the overview (there are no conflicts) then cherry pick two findings from the models that really drive the point home.
15. [DONE] Other misc Chuck comments.
16. Overall, cite results in discussion better.
