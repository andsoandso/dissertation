# The commitee says:
0. [DONE] Third person impersonal.
1. [DONE] Chuck and Carol's line edits.
2. Weaken Dommett el al's 100 ms argument, new cites?
3. Show/state clearly this is not higher-order conditioning.
4. [DONE] Link long DA discussion to the rest, and clarify what I mean by DA (i.e. phasic DA from VTA/SNc _only_), also improve abstract to reflect these changes.
5. Citations for behavior.
6. Include/mention simulation results so that people see why the significance tests are all significant and why ranking is a better approach.
7. Make plain that the model tests the implicit assumption about what is happening cognitively, i.e. inference necessity.
8. [DONE] Map of methods at the start of the methods section, high level description.
9. [DONE] At end of intro Chuck wants a summary of why the work matters, the most significant result(s).
10. [DONE] Create a map (at the start) of Chap 3 as well.
11. In the discussion link the intro to it, then make the significance of the work crystal clear.
12. [DONE] Equation fixes.
13. [DONE] Make reward definitions very clear, right from the start (do this before 3.).
14. Rework discussion as discussed with Chuck, review the overview (there are no conflicts) then cherry pick two findings from the models that really drive the point home.  Overall, cite results better.
15. Chuck's marked pages
