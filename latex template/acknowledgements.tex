I would like to first thank my advisor, Dr. Sue van den Heever, for all of her support, encouragement, and advice over the years.  I am proud to be her first student, and I know many great scientists will follow me.  I would like to extend thanks to my committee members as well.  Drs. Graeme Stephens, Richard Johnson, and Richard Eykholt have offered valuable insight and my work has been better for their input.

I need to thank several people without whom this research would not have been completed.  Steve Saleeby, thank you for the budgeting code, and for countless modeling questions answered.  Tristan L'Ecuyer, thank you for your help and insight into observational data, and for your helpful suggestions as a co-author.  Matt Lebsock, thank you for providing model data, and for helpful conversations about dealing with satellite data.  Natalie Tourville, thank you for keeping my computers working over the past few years.  All of the members of the van den Heever research group have been a great help, and I think them all for the useful conversations and the fun ones.  I need to express my gratitude to my friends and family who have supported me through this process, and haven't let a crazy, stressed out grad student scare them away.

  This work was funded by the National Science Foundation under Grant NSFATM-513 0820557.
